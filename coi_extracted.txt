COURSE OF INSTRUCTION CHANGE PROPOSALS  The Academy has established procedures for updating and revising the Academy curriculum.  These procedures are explained in detail in the Academy Instruction 36-3526, the Academy Course of Instruction & Change Control.  1-1.4.  OBJECTIVES OF THE ACADEMY CURRICULUM  The Academy develops a diverse pool of professional Air and Space Force officers who:  Lead with Character and Respect by demonstrating skilled leadership, teamwork, and organizational management, while living ethically with unwavering respect for human dignity;  Integrate Knowledge about Human Cultures and the Natural World by valuing the human condition, cultures, and societies, employing the principles of science and scientific reasoning, and harnessing the fundamentals of engineering;  Address complex and uncertain problems with agile intellectual skills sustained by effective communication and critical thinking;  Defend our nation in air, space, and cyberspace by maintaining the national security of the American Republic, with dedication to the warrior ethos as airmen and guardians.  The Academy Institutional Outcome white papers are included in Appendix 1.  The Academy Institutional Outcomes are:  Critical Thinking – to apply self-aware, informed, and reflective reasoning for problem solving and decision making in the absence of ideal information.  Clear Communication – to express ideas in written or oral formats with the intent to enhance knowledge, foster understanding, or stimulate new thinking.  Application of Engineering Problem-Solving Methods – to understand the opportunities, requirements, and constraints imposed by the scientific and mathematical workings of the universe, supported by knowledge of the current and projected state of technology.  Scientific Reasoning and the Principles of Science – to apply scientific habits of mind, including proficiency in the nature of science, scientific reasoning, and the principles of science.  Ethics and Respect for Human Dignity – to recognize ethical alternatives among  the options available, use ethical judgment to select the best alternative, and act consistently to respect the dignity of all affected persons.  The Human Condition, Cultures, and Societies – to comprehend what it means to be human, the individual situated in a culture and society, and the interactions of people from different socio-cultural milieus.  National Security of the American Republic in a Complex Global Environment – to possess the knowledge necessary to protect the fundamental values and core interests of the United States, and recognize the broader political context in which military force must be employed.  Warrior Ethos as Airmen and Guardians – to persevere despite physical and mental hardships, embrace the oath of office and the profession of arms, adopt the core values, and value all Airmen and Guardians.  Leadership, Teamwork, and Organizational Management – to apply character-based leadership principles at the personal, interpersonal, team, and organizational levels.  Academic Program  Provides cadets with general courses in the basic sciences, engineering, social sciences, and humanities to form a Liberal Arts foundation for their development as future Air and Space Force officers. The broad core curriculum at the Academy continues to hold true to the belief of its founders, that national leaders require multidisciplinary perspectives and skills to solve the nation’s complex problems.   Offers elective courses to meet cadets’ needs and desires.  Motivates cadets toward advanced education through enrichment courses (e.g., advanced placement, audit, special topics, and independent study).  Prepares cadets to fulfill their intellectual responsibilities as citizens and dedicated public servants in the Air and Space Forces.  Military Training  Provides cadets with the education, training, and experiences necessary to commission as an officer in the United States Air and Spaces Forces.  Offers a multi-dimensional developmental approach across 47 months to prepare cadets to lead with character as officers in the United States Air and Space Forces.  Educates cadets in their roles and responsibilities as members of the profession of arms.   Physical Education and Athletics  Further develops desirable traits of character essential to leadership, including warrior ethos, persistence, desire to win, aggressiveness, and esprit de corps.  Teaches skills needed to perform challenging physical tasks.  Encourages a positive attitude toward lifetime physical fitness.  Airmanship   Airmanship programs include soaring, parachuting, powered flight, Unmanned Aerial Systems/Remotely Piloted Aircraft operations, and all associated competition teams. Per the Academy Mission Directive Six, the Academy/A3 is the Office of  Primary Responsibility (OPR).  The Academy is authorized to utilize unique airmanship programs in support of the cadet development mission (USAFAFI 36-3501, The Academy Operations).  The overall goal is to foster "Airmindedness:” a global, strategic mindset providing perspective through which the battlespace is not constrained by geography, distance, location, or time.  This goal is achieved through three program objectives:  Educate all cadets on the concept of airpower, as defined in Air Force Doctrine Volume I as the ability to project military power or influence through the control and exploitation of air, space, and cyberspace to achieve strategic, operational, or tactical objectives.  Cadets should understand the intellectual foundations behind airpower, articulate its proper applications, and understand Air Force aviation's history, traditions, demands, and emerging capabilities.  Inspire cadets and provide motivational, character-building experiences that contribute to informed career decisions and allow the Academy to meet its Rated Training Allocation requirements.   Train cadets to ensure graduates awarded rated assignments possess the attitude, aptitude, skills, and confidence necessary to excel in Undergraduate Pilot Training or other rated career fields.  (7) Character and Leadership Development  Guided by USAFA Manual 36-3526, Developing Leaders of Character at USAFA (USAFAMAN 36-3526), which outlines a framework for developing leaders of character and provides guidance for how Academy personnel can foster a personal commitment to leadership development in their day-to-day roles, and help them grow as leader-developers. The Leader of Character Framework is depicted in Figure 1.   Prepares cadets to fulfill their responsibilities as leaders of character who live honorably, lift others, and elevate performance.  Takes place across academic, military, athletic, and airmanship education, training, and experiences throughout the 47-month experience. /Figure 1. The Leader of Character Framework (USAFAMAN 36-3526)  1-1.5.  GRADUATION AND RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS To graduate from the Academy, a cadet must demonstrate an aptitude for commissioned service and leadership, display acceptable conduct, maintain proficiency in physical education and the commissioning education program, and meet all requirements for an academic major unless approved for the Bachelor of Science Program.  To fulfill academic requirements, cadets must satisfactorily complete the core curriculum with a minimum 2.0 core grade point average (GPA).  Cadets must also meet the minimum standard of a 2.0 cumulative GPA.  All cadets must declare a major, unless approved for the Bachelor of Science Program, and earn a minimum 2.0 GPA in that major.  A cadet must complete at least eight semesters in residence at the Academy. A semester spent in an Academy-sponsored exchange program/semester abroad, not to exceed one, counts as a semester in residence.  A cadet must take at least 125 semester hours at the Academy (including those completed in Academy-sponsored exchange programs, not to exceed 24 semester hours) to satisfy residency requirements, regardless of semester hours transferred and validated.  Courses which do not fulfill residency requirements include those validated or transferred, courses carrying no semester hour credit, and failed courses.      A cadet’s commissioning education includes a course of study in professional military education and the leadership laboratory experience provided by being part of the Cadet Wing.  Each cadet is evaluated on military performance each semester and must maintain a minimum 2.0 cumulative military performance appraisal (MPA) level of performance for graduation.  Before graduation, each cadet must successfully complete each of the Core Military Training programs as a student.  Each cadet must successfully complete two leadership programs, one of which must be a Military Leadership program.  Each cadet must successfully pass Basic Cadet Training (BCT), Combat Survival Training (CST), and participate in Ops Air Force/Space Force as summer programs required for graduation. Leadership credit can be obtained during the school year if key leadership positions within the Cadet Wing are held for the entire semester.   To fulfill the athletic graduation requirements, a cadet must satisfactorily complete the physical education (Phy Ed) curriculum (5.0 semester hours), earn a cumulative physical education average (PEA) of at least a 2.00, pass the AF PFA (Air Force Physical Fitness Assessment), and participate in approved competitive athletics (intramural, club, or intercollegiate) in each semester of residency. PEA is a function of three performance scores: cadet physical fitness test (PFT), cadet aerobic fitness test (AFT) and Phy Ed courses. 	1-1.6. INTERNATIONAL CADETS 	 Students who are citizens of foreign countries are designated International Cadets.  International Cadets for whom English is a second language are awarded validation credit for their native language. They must fulfill all other Academy graduation requirements to earn a Bachelor of Science degree; those International Cadets who do not fulfill all requirements before graduation are awarded a certificate of completion stating they attended the Academy for four years.  For details, refer to COI 2-6.7 English as a Second Language. International cadets are not authorized to participate in RPA Airmanship courses.  CHAPTER 2 ACADEMICS  SECTION 2-1 THE CORE  	2-1.1. INTEGRATED CORE 	   Why do we have a large, integrated Core at the Academy? The Core The Core “is rooted in the best traditions of the past, taught in the context of the present, and continually reexamined in the light of the future needs of the Air Force.”   - Lt Gen James E. Briggs, USAF ACADEMY 2nd  Superintendent The Core is one of the distinctive elements that make an Academy education particularly valuable to the Air and Space Forces and the Nation.  The Core is purposefully and developmentally designed to build proficiency in nine outcomes to prepare cadets for future service as commissioned officers.  Components of the Core are taught by faculty and staff members within the Dean of the Faculty, the Commandant of Cadets, the Athletic Department, and the 306th  Flying Training Group.  Over the years, our Core has changed to meet the needs of an evolving world.  The Core builds on the best traditions of the Academy, takes advantage of current thinking in education and information technology, and keeps a keen eye on the future needs of a 21st  century military serving in an increasingly complex global environment. The Core is infused with the ideals of a liberal  education yet grounded in the needs of a modern military through a blend of education, training, and experience.    Liberal Education Liberal education is an “approach to learning that empowers individuals and prepares them to deal with complexity, diversity and change.  It provides students with broad knowledge of the wider world (e.g. science, culture and society) as well as in-depth study in a specific area of interest.”  – American Association of Colleges and Universities Because of the unique role the Core plays in developing officers of character for the U.S. Air and Space Forces, the Core is more extensive and more integrated across the institution than is commonly found at other universities and colleges.  In fact, our Core is two to three times larger than the general education requirements found at typical colleges.  Our Core depends on purposeful integration across athletics, academics, military training, and airmanship programs, and facilitates the uniquely immersive experience found at the Academy.  The Core is truly a one-of-a-kind experience that prepares cadets to serve in the greatest Air and Space Forces in the world.  2-1.2.  FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES   The Core is guided by foundational principles that ensure that it meets the highest ideals of a liberal education while providing the best preparation for a lifetime of service to the Nation.  This balance of attaining a broad education while immersed in the history, traditions, and professional values of military service 2  is the unique and critical contribution of the / Academy to the officer corps.  The Core directly supports Air and Space Force commissioning requirements while providing the educational depth and breadth of a world-class Bachelor of Science degree.  No other commissioning source can create the collaborative blending of everpresent military training, rigorous academics, and competitive athletics that defines the communal experience of every graduate of the Academy.  While the size and content of the Core has changed over the years, this basic principle of a balanced, immersive Academy experience remains constant.  The depth and breadth found at the Academy provides “a core group of innovative leaders capable of thinking critically who will exert positive peer influences to convey and sustain the traditions, attitudes, values, and beliefs essential to the long-term readiness and success” of the Air and Space Forces.    USAF Academy Foundational Core Principles To achieve our Institutional Outcomes, we are committed to providing: /A broad liberal education that imbues in cadets the knowledge, skills, and habits of mind necessary for service as exemplary officers and citizens; a curriculum fostering guided self-discovery and collaboration, the spirit of free inquiry, and the open exchange of ideas;  A Core that calls for cadets to study and experience chosen subjects in depth, as creative, independent thinkers comfortable with uncertainty, paradox, and complexity; and  A Core that prepares and inspires graduates to continue learning and serving throughout their lives.  This Core should ultimately deepen cadet understanding of what it means to serve as an American military officer dedicated to the profession of arms and ready for the responsibilities of command. /      / 2-1.3.  THE ACADEMY OUTCOMES   Future Air and Space Force leaders must demonstrate a sophisticated combination of qualities that define the character of members of a modern profession of arms. At the Academy, we operationally define these professional characteristics in nine Academy Outcomes.  Every faculty and staff member serving at the Academy – regardless of their specific role – plays an important part in building Air and Space Force leaders of character by developing the proficiencies articulated in the following nine outcomes.  The Academy Outcomes reflect the two complementary roles the Academy plays within the American military landscape: developing commissioned officers and providing a world-class college education.  The higher education community has informed our Core with the best ideals of a liberal education that provides cadets with a sophisticated understanding of the knowledge and thinking skills needed in our complex, 21st  century world.  Simultaneously, the Air and Space Forces have provided us with a sense of unity and mission not often shared by institutions of higher learning.  Therefore, the Academy Outcomes reflect the joint contribution of both the Air and Space Forces and the higher education community as described in the Air Force’s Commissioning Sources’ Institutional Competency Learning Outcomes   as well as the Association of American College and Universities’ (AAC&U) Essential Learning Outcomes.    The combination of these two cultures provides the Academy with a synergistic focus that is richer and more informed than either community provides on its own.  The Outcome white papers are included in Appendix 1.  Critical Thinking – to apply self-aware, informed, and reflective reasoning for problem solving and decision making in the absence of ideal information. Clear Communication – to express ideas in written or oral formats with the intent to enhance knowledge, foster understanding, or stimulate new thinking. USAF Academy Outcome Statement USAF Academy develops a diverse group of professional Air and Space Force officers who think critically, lead with character, and serve the nation.  These developmental goals are achieved by the USAF ACADEMY Course of Instruction, which is designed to accomplish nine institutional outcomes. Application of Engineering Problem-Solving Methods – to understand the opportunities, requirements, and constraints imposed by the scientific and mathematical workings of the universe, supported by knowledge of the current and projected state of technology. Scientific Reasoning and the Principles of Science – to apply scientific habits of mind, including proficiency in the nature of science, scientific reasoning, and the principles of science. The Human Condition, Cultures, and Societies – to comprehend what it means to be human, the individual situated in a culture and society, and the interactions of people from different socio-cultural milieus. Leadership, Teamwork, and Organizational Management – to apply character-based leadership principles at the personal, interpersonal, team, and organizational levels. / Ethics and Respect for Human Dignity – to recognize ethical alternatives among the options available, use ethical judgment to select the best alternative, and act consistently to respect the dignity of all affected persons. National Security of the American Republic in a Complex Global Environment – to possess the knowledge necessary to protect the fundamental values and core interests of the United States and recognize the broader political context in which military force must be employed. Warrior Ethos as Airmen and Guardians – to persevere despite physical and mental hardships, embrace the oath of office and the profession of arms, adopt the core values, and value all Airmen.  2-1.4.  COURSES AND PROGRAMS   The Academy Core consists of 29 Dean of Faculty academic courses (93 semester hours), 10 Athletic Department Physical Education courses (5 semester hours), and a large number of Commandant of Cadets and 306th  Flying Training Group courses and programs.  In addition to the Academic Core, all cadets take one of two academic programs.  These programs include the Academic Majors (36 – 50 semester hours beyond the Core) and the Bachelor of Science Program (30 semester hours beyond the Core).  Both options are fully described in Sections 2-8 and 2-9.  2-1.5.  LEVELS OF THE CORE   The Core is designed to support the Academy Outcomes through a developmental sequencing of courses, programs, and training at foundational, intermediate, and advanced levels.  Transitions between the levels represent a continuum rather than clearly defined stages.  /What do we mean by Foundational? These courses are typically taken by fourth- and third-class cadets.  These courses and programs serve as both an introduction to College-level work and as an introduction to the history, traditions, and professional values of military service.  Foundational-level core experiences provide cadets with introductory courses and programs important to the more advanced Core as well as to their future service as Air and Space Force officers.  Examples of these experiences include Basic Cadet Training, introductory academic and physical education courses, and an introduction to airmanship.  After completing the Foundational-level core, cadets have an introductory proficiency in all nine Academy Outcomes.  Choice at the Foundational Level of the Core: All cadets take identical education, training, and  experiences at the foundational level unless they have transfer or validation credit (for details on transfer/validation credit, go to the “Core Administration” section at the end of this chapter).  What do we mean by Intermediate? These courses are typically taken by third- and second-class cadets. The Intermediate Core builds  on education, training, and experiences found in the Foundational Core as cadets explore both depth and breadth activities in each of the nine Academy Outcomes. In some cases, these courses  and programs add depth to cadet thinking by building on previous knowledge from courses in the same disciplines found in the Foundational Level.  Examples are second courses in math, physics, and chemistry or follow-on airmanship programs.  In other cases, these courses and programs explore breadth in thinking through new courses in a related discipline not previously studied.  An example of this is the three course breadth sequence in Air (Aeronautical Engineering), Space (Astronautical Engineering), and Cyberspace (Electrical and Computer Engineering) found at the Intermediate Level in the Principles of Engineering Outcome.  After completing the Intermediate Core, cadets have developed breadth and depth in the proficiencies in all nine Academy Outcomes.  Choice at the Intermediate Level of the Core: At the Intermediate level, cadets have some choice in the Core.  The choice is limited to provide some ability for cadets to tailor their experiences to personal and professional goals without compromising their ability to complete their graduation requirements in four years.  This choice is primarily within and not across individual Outcomes and the choices may be constrained by a cadet’s chosen major.  Cadets should refer to the Major’s requirements listed in Section 2-8 or meet with their Fourth-Class Advisor or Academic Advisor before selecting their Intermediate option courses in order to create a program that meets their interests while ensuring all program and graduation requirements are met in time for graduation. The following are the choices available at the Intermediate Level: In the Critical Thinking Outcome, all cadets are required to take a course in statistical reasoning.  However, this requirement can be filled by taking Math 300, Introduction to Statistics; Math 356, Probability and Statistics for Scientists and Engineers; Math 377, Advanced Probability and Statistics.   In the Scientific Reasoning and the Principles of Science Outcome, all cadets are required to take two intermediate courses chosen from three available options.  Cadets will pick two of the following three courses: Physics 215, General Physics II with Laboratory; Chem 200, General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab; or Biology 215, Introductory Biology with Laboratory. In the Warrior Ethos as Airmen and Guardians Outcome and the Leadership, Teamwork, and Organizational Management Outcome, all cadets are required to take three Physical Education courses in team and individual sports.  Cadets may choose from the following sports and activities to fulfill this requirement. Team Sports Elective (one required, may be taken in any upperclass year) Phy Ed 484 Volleyball  Phy Ed 486 Basketball Phy Ed 487 Soccer Phy Ed 488 Softball Individual Sports Elective (one required, may be taken in any upperclass year) Phy Ed 340 Racquetball Phy Ed 341 Tennis Phy Ed 342 Golf Phy Ed 343 Indoor Rock Climbing Phy Ed 344 Yoga Phy Ed 345 Advanced Physical Development Phy Ed 346 Pickleball Phy Ed 347  Self-Protection Phy Ed 348  Marksmanship  Open Elective (one required, may be taken in any upperclass year) Any of the electives above not already taken Phy Ed 477*Independent Exercise (first- or second-class cadets only)  	  Phy Ed 479*Cadet Instructor (first- or second-class cadets only)  	  * Cadets are registered for these courses by the Athletic Department Scheduling and Grading Division (ADPEG), IAW ADOI 36-3504.  What do we mean by Advanced? These courses are typically taken by second- and first-class cadets. The advanced-level Core represents the most depth and the most choice in the Core.  Cadets take advanced-level courses and programs in some, but not all, of the nine Academy Outcomes.  Cadets develop specific proficiencies in the Clear Communication and Critical Thinking Outcomes within their chosen major.  Other programs such as the National Character and Leadership Symposium and cadet Leadership requirements provide chances to dig deeply into the proficiencies described in the Academy Outcomes.  The advanced Core represents the culmination of a cadet’s journey and provides the capstone experiences that complete each cadet’s preparation as new Second Lieutenants in the United States Air Force.  In the Advanced Core, cadets have the most choice.   This provides a breadth of experience across the graduating class while providing individual cadets with the ability to choose areas to explore with greater depth and effort.  Advanced choice is available to cadets in both the Academic and Military/Airmanship Core.    In the Advanced Academic Core, cadets have three choices.  Some majors may require specific courses in order to meet graduation requirements for that major.  Other majors may allow more freedom in choices.  Cadets should refer to the Major’s requirements listed in Section 2-8 or meet with their Fourth-Class Advisor or Academic Advisor before selecting their advanced option courses in order to create a program that meets their interests while ensuring all program and graduation requirements are met in time for graduation.  Choice #1: Advanced Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Choice – Pick one of the courses below which support one of the following Outcomes:  1) Application of Engineering Problem-Solving Methods, or 2) Scientific Reasoning and the Principles of Science: Biology 345 Aerospace Physiology o Biology 370 Human Nutrition o Chem 222 Analytical Chemistry o Chem 350 Chemistry of Weapons Civ Engr 356 	Introduction to Sustainability Comp Sci 210 Programming Fundamentals o Geo 351 Physical Geography o Math 243/253 Calculus III o Math 245 Differential Equations o Meteor 320 Introduction to Meteorology and Aviation Weather Meteor 352 	Climatology o Ops Rsch 310 	Systems Analysis o Physics 310 	Principles of Nuclear Science o Physics 371 	Astronomy Sys Engr 310 	Introduction to Systems Engineering  Choice #2:  Advanced Sociocultural Choice – Pick one of the courses below which support one of the following outcomes: 1) The Human Condition, Cultures, and Societies, 2) Leadership, Teamwork, and Organizational Management, 3) Ethics and Respect for Human Dignity, 4) National Security of the American Republic, or 5) Warrior Ethos as Airmen and Guardians: Beh Sci 360 Sociology o English 411 War Stories o Geo 412 World Cultural Geography o History 345 The American Way of War o Mgt 400 Leading Innovation o MSS 444 Space & Cyber Strategy for National Security o Philos 401 Comparative Religion o Pol Sci 302 American Foreign and National Security Policy o Soc Sci 483 Principles of Negotiation  Choice #3:  Advanced Open Choice – Choose any course from either choice #1 or choice #2. Cadets who have Health Professions Advisory Committee (HPAC) approval (usually during the Spring of second-class year) to apply for a health professions program may submit a waiver to count the third P/C/B Option as the Advanced Open Choice.  Military and Airmanship Advanced Core Choices: In the Leadership, Teamwork, and Organizational Management Outcome, cadets are required to complete a minimum of two Leadership Practicums in their second- or first-class year from the list below.  Cadets choose from the following options to demonstrate and practice advanced leadership, teamwork, and organizational management abilities.  At least one of these credits must be accomplished in a military program under the Commandant of Cadets (in bold in the list below).  • 	Any commander selected from the Command Selection Board • 	BCT Cadre, CST Cadre, Summer Ops Group Cadre and Staff • 	CE-FERL Leadership, AETC Leadership Ops, Prep School BMT Cadre Soaring Instructor, Parachuting Instructor, RPA Instructor, Cyber Instructor, or Space Instructor Intercollegiate or Competitive Club Sport Team Captain In the Warrior Ethos as Airmen and Guardians Outcome, all cadets are required to take one Physical Education course in advanced warfighting preparation during their first or second-class years.

OUTCOME COURSES AND PROGRAMS   The following pages describe the Core courses and programs that developmentally align with each of the nine Academy Outcomes.  Each Outcome is guided by an Outcome Team comprised of faculty and staff from the courses and programs listed for that Outcome.  In addition, each team normally includes at least one member not in one of the aligned courses and programs, and at least one cadet.  All courses and programs listed in this Handbook contribute to one or more of our Academy Outcomes.  However, the courses and programs listed in the Outcome descriptions on the following pages are committed to a more intensive role in that Outcome.  These courses and programs are committed to defining the proficiencies of that Outcome; aligning education, training, and experiences with the proficiencies; and leading Outcome assessment efforts.      /  Critical Thinking Outcome  -

Cadets choose from the following options to demonstrate and practice advanced leadership, teamwork, and organizational management abilities.  At least one of these credits must be accomplished in a military program under the Commandant of Cadets (in bold in the list below).  Any commander selected from the Command Selection Board  BCT Cadre, CST Cadre, Summer Ops Group Cadre and Staff  CE-FERL Leadership, AETC Leadership Ops, Prep School BMT Cadre Soaring Instructor, Parachuting Instructor, UAS Instructor, Cyber Instructor, or Space Instructor Intercollegiate or Competitive Club Sport Team Captain • Intercollegiate Courses (cadets may substitute Phy Ed course credit for each year on an intercollegiate roster as follows): o Phy Ed 352 – Second-Class Intercollegiate Sports (sub for Team Sport Elective) o Phy Ed 452 – First-Class Intercollegiate Sports (sub for Open Elective)  Core Administration  Course Sequence and Flexibility in the Core Core courses are numbered for the year in which the course is typically taken (e.g., 100-level for fourth-class cadets, 400-level for first-class cadets).  The course number will therefore reflect the developmental level of the course, not necessarily the nature of the course content or the course’s alignment with the developmental level of an Outcome.  Core courses should be taken in their intended class year and follow the developmental sequence prescribed by the Outcome description as much as possible.  Majors’ sequencing should be designed to facilitate this, subject to required programmatic constraints. The flexibility in the Core should come from the majors’ sequencing rather than from Core sequencing.  Accommodations for specific cadet needs can be made with the approval of the respective Department Head(s) and the Associate Dean for Student Academic Affairs.  Core Preparation Course EAP 109 is a three-semester hour course, scheduled for international cadets.  Whenever possible, ESL cadets will take EAP during their first semester, English 111 their second semester, and English 211 their third semester.  Grade Protection Cadets placed into Math 152 (Calculus II), Math 253 (Calculus III), Math 245 (Differential Equations) or Chem 200 (General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab) in their fourth-class fall will have grade protection. Cadets deficient (“C-” or “D” or “F”) at prog may withdraw and receive a “W” grade on their transcript or they may stay enrolled in the course.  A cadet who stays enrolled will not be placed on academic probation at prog solely based on a deficient or failing grade in their advanced-placed course. Cadets earning a “C-” or “D” at the end of the semester in one of the Math courses may either a) keep the grade earned in the course or b) immediately retake Calculus II (Math 142), Calculus III (Math 243), or Differential Equations (Math 245) respectively in the spring semester and receive a “WP” grade on their transcript in place of the deficient grade for the fall. Note: a proficient grade (“C” or better) is generally required to move on to  the next higher mathematics course; see the course descriptions later in this handbook for specific details on course pre-requisites.  Cadets who fail Math 152 at the end of the semester will be given a “W” on their transcript and be automatically enrolled in Math 142 in the spring semester. Cadets who fail Math 253 or Math 245 at the end of the semester will be given a “W” on their transcript and can retake Calculus III or Differential Equations respectively depending on the requirements of their selected major. Cadets who fail Chem 200 at the end of the semester will be given a “W” on their transcript.  Math 243   During their first attempt at Math 243, all cadets will have grade protection.  Cadets may drop the course anytime during the semester through Lesson 30 and receive a “W”. Cadets previously enrolled in Math 253 are not eligible for grade protection.  A cadet will not be considered deficient in academics solely based on a deficient grade at prog in Math 243.  Core Requirements Checklists  Athletic Department Requirements Cadets must pass Phy Ed 100, Basic Physical Training, during Basic Cadet Training, participate in a competitive experience (intramurals, clubs, or intercollegiate athletics) every semester, and pass a minimum of 10 Physical Education (Phy Ed) courses, each worth 0.5 semester hours of course credit.  With few exceptions, cadets take Phy Ed courses each of their eight semesters.  Most Phy Ed courses consist of an 8-Lesson block of instruction.  Two Phy Ed courses will be taken in the fourth- and first-class years.  Three Phy Ed courses will be taken in the third- and  second-class years.  The normal Phy Ed progression is shown in Table 1; Table 2 depicts the required core (Foundational) and elective (Intermediate or Advanced) Phy Ed courses/options as well as the activities that meet advanced athletic criteria.  Table 1.

To aid in the implementation of this Core, the Academy codified / an Assessment and Improvement Process (ref: The Academy Instruction 36-3502, Institutional Effectiveness) that explains how the Core will evolve over time. In short, the Academy has constructed a cross-functional team for each Outcome, and each of those teams is responsible for (1) revising the Outcome, as needed; (2) overseeing the integrated development of the Outcome; (3) coordinating efforts to assess cadet accomplishment of the Outcome; (4) synthesizing assessment results for both internal and external reporting; and (5) facilitating improvements in courses and programs, as necessary.  The Assessment and Improvement Process is designed to reveal shortcomings in the Core as it currently exists, as well as opportunities for greater effectiveness in achieving Outcome proficiencies. As a result, there will undoubtedly be situations where core offerings associated with Outcomes will need to be changed in some way.  Proposals for such changes should be coordinated with members of the relevant Outcome Team and all affected Academic Departments or Major Units prior to submission of a Course of Instruction Change Proposal (CCP) IAW The Academy Instruction 36-3526, USAFA Course of Instruction & Change Control.  The potential also exists for Academic Departments and/or Major Units to pursue the addition of new courses, programs, or experiences to the current core associated with a given Outcome.  These initiatives should be pursued in close collaboration with the affected Outcome Team and in keeping with guidance and processes outlined in the Academy Instruction 36-3502 and the Academy Instruction 36-3526.   	 SECTION 2-2 REGISTRATION  2-2.1.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR REGISTRATION Cadet Responsibilities.  It is the cadet’s responsibility to ensure completion of all graduation requirements.  Each cadet is expected to plan a course of study and maintain satisfactory standards of scholarship and conduct. The faculty stands ready to help when called upon, but the initiative rests with the cadet.  Cadets must meet with their academic advisors at least once each semester prior to the registration deadline for the following semester.  In addition, cadets will take the following steps:  Deliver all annotated Academic Program Summaries (APSs) with course changes for the following semester to DFVRC if after the registration deadline.   Verify the accuracy of each document returned from the Office of Student Academic Affairs following the processing of course change requests.  Ensure the latest copy of the APS reflects plans for meeting graduation requirements.  Coordinate with their Academic Advisors prior to declaring an academic major(s).  Cadets must declare a major no later than a week prior to the registration deadline during their third semester (fall of third-class year). However, some majors – e.g. Computer  Science, Chemistry, and Biology (particularly those interested in pursuing medical school) – should be declared before the end of the fourth-class year due to course sequencing requirements.  Submit an Academy Form O-498, Request for Permission to Enroll in an Independent Study Course, when necessary (see Para 2-1.10).  Comply with all registration changes, academic major declaration, and academic major change procedures and deadlines described in this Handbook.  Advisor-in-Charge (AIC), Academic Advisor, and Fourth-Class Advisor responsibilities:  Hold cadets accountable for meeting deadlines established in this Handbook.  To ensure accomplishment of all necessary administrative requirements, advisors and Fourth-Class Advisors must meet with their advisees at least once each semester prior to the registration deadline for the following semester.  Be available for cadet appointments concerning registration changes, academic program declarations, and academic program changes.  Coordinate all advisee registration changes, academic program declarations, and academic program changes by completing the online registration process. Verify each advisee's program meets course prerequisite requirements and that waivers and department approvals have been obtained and processed as required.  Be responsible for accomplishing counseling, registration changes, or academic program changes with advisees as directed by the Academic Review Committee (ARC).  Initiate, at the beginning of the semester, an annotated APS to drop all overload courses for cadets who do not meet minimum GPA criteria for overloads.   Make sure each advisee's academic program includes all requirements for graduation.  Ensure cadets on academic probation are counseled at each progress report.   Assist and counsel advisees preparing for ARC interviews.   Provide mentoring and guidance towards achievement of the cadets’ personal and professional goals.  2-2.2. ACADEMIC COUNSELING AND ADVISING The Dean of the Faculty has delegated to DFVR responsibility for administering the academic advising and counseling program.  DFVR trains and educates the Fourth-Class Advisors and AICs for each academic program the Academy offers. Academic advising is an integral part of the Academy learning experience. Academic advising includes assisting cadets with course and program selection and registration, helping cadets develop realistic self-perceptions, and successfully transitioning cadets to the Academy environment.  Each Fourth-Class Advisor provides general advice and counsel on academic programs to cadets of their squadron.  Fourth-Class Advisors mentor cadets in selecting an academic program that mirrors the cadets’ life goals and is supported by the cadets’ abilities.  Fourth- Class Advisors keep records on all advisees.  Each AIC is responsible for the advising of all cadets within the applicable academic program. The AIC may have a number of assistants (advisors) to help counsel cadets interested in that discipline; however, it is the AIC that makes all final decisions in administering the program.  The AIC, in general, oversees the proper completion and timely submission of all inputs to the registration system.  In this regard, the AIC serves as the single point of control for all paperwork and procedures concerning the program; DFVR will honor only the AIC's signature or that of a designated alternate.    When advising cadets on alignment between the Academy majors and future AFSCs and SFSCs, advisors and cadets should ensure that the selected Academy major is required, desired, or permitted for the AFSC/SFSC the cadet is pursuing.    The AIC, advisor, or Fourth-Class Advisor keeps a current copy of cadets’ APSs and other academic-related documents to include waivers, graduation checks, Cadet Academic Deficiency Evaluation and Probation Action Plans (Academy Form 68), and special information concerning cadets’ academic programs.  Cadets should keep copies of all information related to their academic programs. Cadets’ official transcripts may be requested  from DFVRR.  The most current APSs are available from COMPASS. Advisors should maintain records for six months following the cadet’s graduation or departure.  2-2.3. PROGRAM PLANNING  During their first semester at the Academy, fourth-class cadets should begin planning their academic program. As an aid to cadets and their Fourth-Class Advisors, DFVRR will pre-register each cadet in all common core courses the cadet must complete at the Academy based upon predetermined semester-load balances negotiated with academic departments.  Cadets and FourthClass Advisors must check APSs for omissions, sequencing errors, and ensure third semesters include prerequisites required by the envisioned academic major.  Cadets may make changes to this initial schedule, provided they satisfy core sequencing policies.  Course offerings are published semi-annually in the Curriculum Handbook Supplement and annually in this handbook.  The two-day Academy scheduling cycle limits the available number of periods (contact hours) to 12.  Because some academic courses meet every day or require a double period for laboratory or seminar meetings, cadets should be careful to keep their programs within the 12period limit each semester.  Cadets should pay particular attention to flying programs that require additional periods.  The number of contact hours for each course is shown in the course description section of this handbook beside the course identifier. For example, an entry "3(2)"  indicates that a course has three semester hours value and meets two contact hours over the two-day scheduling cycle.  Only courses, programs, or experiences that fulfill requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree are considered for semester hour credit.  A semester hour is awarded on the expectation of roughly 40 hours of cadet work over the course of the semester, either in direct interaction with a qualified faculty member or completing out-of-class work associated with the course or program.  Most academic courses at the Academy are 3.0 semester hours, meaning that they will require 120 hours of cadet work over the course of the semester.  This is typically accomplished by meeting for 40 one-hour periods of classroom instruction (minus the institutionally-allotted transit time between classes) and requiring typical cadets to perform roughly 80 hours of out-of-class work over the course of the semester.  Qualified faculty will possess a Master’s degree or higher with 18 credit hours at the graduate level in the academic discipline being taught, or in a related academic discipline.  For exceptional circumstances or where documented and tested experience warrant an exception, consult with the Academy’s Accreditation Liaison Officer. All courses / experiences awarding academic credit shall maintain learning objectives appropriate for undergraduate education.  Additionally, the courses should be part of a routine programmatic or course review. Variants of the typical 3.0 semester hour configuration are possible.  For example, a 3.0 semester hour course could also meet for roughly 80 hours (e.g., in 40 two-hour periods), but only require typical cadets to perform 40 hours of out-of-class work over the course of the semester. It is also possible for courses to deviate from the 3.0 semester hour standard. For example, a 1.0 semester hour course (requiring 40 total hours of cadet work) could meet for 40 one-hour Lessons but expect no out-of-class work or meet for 20 one-hour sessions with the expectation of roughly 20 hours of out-of-class work. Any department offering a course or program with a semester hour designation that deviates from the 3.0 standard is expected to explain how semester hours are computed as part of a Course of Instruction Change Proposal (CCP). The Academy Physical Education (Phy Ed) courses are one notable exception to the 3.0 semester hour standard. All Phy Ed courses are worth 0.5 semester hours.  They consist of eight Lessons, 75 minutes in duration, equating to 10 classroom contact hours.  Cadets are expected to allocate roughly 75 minutes per Lesson to outside class study, practice, preparation, and extra-instruction (EI).  This results in 20 total hours per .5 semester hours Phy Ed course (150 minutes x 8 Lessons) and is therefore proportionate to the 120 hours required for a 3.0 semester hour academic course.  When planning course loads, cadets should attempt to balance their schedules as much as possible.  The waiver authority for maximum course loading is DFVR. The waiverauthority for  minimum course loading is DFW, the Vice Dean for Academics. The waiver process is described in paragraph 2-1.9.  For the fourth-class fall semester, the maximum semester hour load is 18.0 semester hours; the minimum semester hour load is 13.5 semester hours.  Cadets determined to be academically at-risk will take 4 academic courses their first semester plus Lrn Strt 101; the course loads for their first two semesters are determined upon entry into the Academy.   For the fourth-class spring semester, the maximum semester hour load is 21.25 semester hours; the minimum semester hour load is 14.5 semester hours.  The semester hour range for academically at-risk fourth-class cadets in the spring semester is 14.5 – 18 semester hours.  In addition, academically at-risk cadets will normally be granted an academicsplus-summer break slot in the summer prior to their third-class year. If an academically  at-risk cadet earns a 2.80 semester GPA or higher at the end of the fall semester, is academically proficient, and passes all coursework in the fall semester, the cadet can opt out of the academics-plus-summer break slot, opening the opportunity for other summer programs.  For third-class, second-class, and first-class cadets, the maximum semester hour load is 22.0 semester hours; the minimum semester hour load is 14.5 semester hours.  Cadets in good standing may exceed 22.0 semester hours if they have a minimum 3.25 cumulative or previous semester GPA.  The minimum semester hour load for the Wing Commander, Vice Wing Commander, the four Group Commanders, the Wing Director of Character and Honor, the Wing Honor Remediation Officer and Wing Character and Honor Development Officer, and the eight Group Director of Character and Honor and Group Honor Chairperson is 12.5 semester hours.  The NCAA requires intercollegiate student athletes to be enrolled in a minimum semester hour load of 12.0 hours to maintain eligibility for athletic competition.  Visiting one-semester international exchange cadets’ minimum semester hour load is 12.0 semester hours. The waiver authority is the DFLC Dept Head with DFW coordination.  (g) Any cadet placed on academic probation may be ARC-directed to drop a course or courses.  Normal Course Load Progression for Graduation:  Table 7.

CADET OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT PLANNING & ADMISSIONS SUPPORT SYSTEM (COMPASS)   COMPASS is the computer database the Academy personnel use to record cadets’ academic programs.  The Office of Student Academic Affairs staff produces and distributes COMPASS products that cadets and advisors use for registration and monitoring progress toward graduation.  Samples of the APS and the Academic Graduation Check are provided in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively.  Information found on the APS (Figure 2) includes transfer and validation credit, athletic squads, clubs, intramurals, total semester hours for each semester, total cumulative semester hours at the end of each semester, semester and cumulative GPA at the end of each semester, turn back status, academic probation information, and courses taken and planned.  The following areas warrant further explanation:  “Academic Probation" indicates academic probation for mid-semester (Prog), end-ofsemester (End), or end-of-summer term (End) and is a permanent entry for that semester or term.  The semester hour total listed below each semesters’ courses reflects all completed graded courses, completed pass/fail courses, and transfer and validation semester hours’ credit. /The three major sections of the grad check (Figure 3) are Core Requirements, Major Requirements, and Other Courses Taken.  Columns represent the following: The “Requirement” column lists the Master Course File number and the course title.  The “Course” column lists the course filling the requirement.  The “GPA” column lists each GPA (i.e. core (C), 1st  major (M1), and/or 2nd  major (M2)) toward which that course counts. Courses may be included in more than one GPA.  The “Wvr” column indicates if that course was waived (Y) into that requirement.  The “Sem” column lists the semester in which the course was taken or is planned.  The "Grd" column lists the final grade, the mid-term grade, or no grade for a course not yet taken (*) or scheduled (--).  A ‘T’ indicates transfer credit; a ‘V’ indicates validation credit.  The “Hrs” column lists the semester hours for the course filling that requirement, rounded to the nearest tenth. / Verification of Graduation Requirements.  (a) It is the cadet’s responsibility to review their Grad Check to verify if they are on track to graduate with the assistance of the Squadron Commander and the Academic Advisor.  (b)  Academic Requirements:  During the fall semester, DFVR audits the core curriculum portion of each first-class cadet's graduation check to ensure all core requirements have been or will be met.    (c) Verification of Military Graduation Requirements and Athletic Graduation Requirements:  Commandant of Cadets personnel will audit and verify the military training curriculum portion of cadets’ graduation checks to ensure all military training requirements have been or will be met.  ADP will audit and verify the physical education curriculum portion of each cadet’s graduation check to ensure their physical education course requirements and their Physical Education Average (PEA) status fulfills graduation requirements.  Semester and term titles in COMPASS APS are as follows:  Table 8. Semester Titles Semester/Term COMPASS Term Titles Summer Term 2025 2255 Fall Semester 2025 2258 Spring Semester 2026 2261 Summer Term 2026 2265   2-2.5.  REGISTRATION PERIODS  Four types of registration periods occur:  Special Semester Registration: Changes authorized anytime.  Coordination by all affected departments is required.  Changes authorized:  Drop courses per course drop timetable (Table 10)  First-class only: correct grad check discrepancies (department coordination required)  Department-approved changes to lower/higher-level courses  Academic Review Committee-directed changes  Change of advisor and/or major  Late Registration:  Registration changes for the next semester requested after that semester’s registration deadline (e.g., changes to spring requested in December).  Obtain approval to add or drop classes from each affected Department Head or representative in the form of a signature on the APS.  Future Semester On-Line Registration:  Registration changes for future fall and spring semesters are accepted anytime in COMPASS by the cadet’s assigned advisor.  If the registration deadline for that semester has passed, late registration procedures apply (see para 2-1.5b).  Department coordination is required during on-line registration for future semesters if the change violates course prerequisites or the course requires department approval as directed by the course description (Appendix 2).  Summer Registration:  Summer academic course registration occurs in the spring semester preceding the summer term.  Details will be advertised by DFVR to cadets and advisors.  2-2.6. CHANGES AFFECTING FUTURE SEMESTERS Schedule changes to future semesters can be made any time before the registration deadline for that semester as advertised by DFVR.  The registration deadline for the spring semester occurs in the October preceding it.  The registration deadline for the fall semester occurs in the April preceding it.  Advisors/ Fourth-Class Advisors can enter registration changes for future semesters through COMPASS’s On-Line Registration System.  Moving a core course in excess of +/- one  year outside its designated year requires an academic waiver approved by the Associate Dean for Student Academic Affairs (DFVR).  Registration - Options:   Add Course to Schedule (add course to future semester)  Move Selected Course to… (move future course to a different semester)  Swap Terms for Selected Courses (change semesters for two future courses)  Replace Selected Course with… (replace future course with a new course)  Delete Selected Course (delete course from future semester)  Registration – Rules of Engagement:  Only academic courses can be changed with COMPASS (i.e. no Phy Ed no Armnshp, or CE).  Advisors can only change advisees’ courses.  AICs can make changes to cadets within their major.  Schedules for the current semester must be changed by DFVR after coordination with affected departments per registration guidance. After the registration deadline for the  upcoming semester, advisors will not be able to make on-line changes for that semester.  AICs must validate registration changes (e.g. manually check course prerequisites).  Advisors verify changes were made (i.e. view new APS next day).  Only offered courses can be added in associated semesters.  Advisors should verify changes are consistent with course load minimums and maximums (see para 2-1.3d).  Advisors should ensure registered courses do not exceed 12 hours contact time maximum.  Advisors should ensure cadets meet all graduation requirements (core and major).  Registration changes after the registration deadline must be submitted IAW paragraph  2-2.8.  2-2.7. CHANGES AFFECTING CURRENT SEMESTER   DFVR classifies any changes affecting the present semester as current semester changes.  Cadets must attend the courses printed on their academic schedules until they receive a new schedule via the COMPASS webpage. Instructors are required to mark as absent any cadet who does not attend  class and is still on their roster.  The cadet will drop from the instructor roster at the effective time that their schedules are changed.  An instructor may allow a cadet to attend a class a cadet is attempting to add during the cadet's free period until the cadet receives the schedule change.  Checklist for Changes to Current Semester. All changes attempted after the normal registration period require appropriate Department Head (or designated representative) coordination; course drops must meet the deadlines listed in the course drop timeline (Table 10).  Cadet and advisor/ Fourth-Class Advisor work out desired changes, performing the following:  Course offering check (are courses taught in semesters desired?)  Core course sequencing check   Academic program course check (are all required courses scheduled?)  Prerequisite check  Underload/overload check    Contact hour check (are 12 or fewer contact hours scheduled per semester?)  Duplicate course check (are any courses scheduled more than once?)  Cadet and advisor/ Fourth-Class Advisor annotate a current APS with desired changes.   For current semester changes, the APS must be coordinated by the following:  Cadet, advisor/Fourth-Class Advisor, and AIC (if the cadet has declared an academic major)  Department Head or designated representative for each course that is added or dropped  Coordination with the following agencies, if affected by changes:  Table 9. Course Coordination Course Req’d Coordination Armnshp Courses A3O Aviation Courses A3O Phy Ed Courses ADP Space Courses DFAS   Directed Changes.  DFVRR may change a cadet's schedule to correct errors or to balance course load.  DFVR may make changes to implement decisions resulting from the Academic Review Committee process.  If any of these changes requires a cadet to drop or add a course, DFVRC will sign the annotated APS as the initiating authority or may ask the advisor/Fourth-Class Advisor to sign the change request as the initiating authority.   Cadets will drop necessary courses or initiate a waiver during Lesson 1 to comply with the overload policy for cadets whose grade point averages at the beginning of a semester are insufficient to carry their desired enrollment (see overload policy, para 2-1.3d, and Definition of Terms).  Adding a Course.  To add a course in the current semester, the cadet and Advisor/ FourthClass Advisor must coordinate with DFVR and submit an APS signed by the Department Head (or designated representative) of the class being added.  After Lesson 3, no courses can be added without Department Head coordination and Vice Dean for Academics approval, coordinated through DFVR.  Dropping a Course.  A cadet may drop an academic program, elective, or core course during the semester with DFVR approval if not dropping below minimum semester hour requirements outlined in para 2-1.3d. To drop or make changes to an Airmanship course, cadets must  coordinate with the A3O Registrar (av.am.scheduling@afacademy.af.edu).  Approval to drop a course is subject to the timeline shown in 10 and dependent upon ability to retake the course within proper sequencing guidelines.  2-2.8. CHANGING AN ACADEMIC PROGRAM SUMMARY   Cadets and their advisors may make changes to a cadet's program either in COMPASS or by annotating required changes in RED INK on a current copy of the cadet's APS.  Ensure that the most current APS is submitted for changes.  To drop courses, circle them (don't line out courses; this indicates no change to DFVR personnel).  If the course is circled in error, line through the circle and the class will not be dropped.  To add courses, write them in under the appropriate semester.  To declare or change an academic program, annotate above the advisor's name.  Changes made to the 7th  or 8th  semester of a first-class cadet must include the graduation check to allow DFVR to verify graduation requirements will be met.  If any APS changes are initiated by a person or group other than the cadet and the cadet’s academic advisor, both the cadet and advisor will be notified by that entity within 24 hours of the change. Table 10. Course Drop Timeline LESSON ACTION  M1 - T8 Course will not appear in mid-semester progress report or on official transcript. Cadets must have Fourth-Class Advisor /Advisor and AIC (if applicable) coordination for their intended drops along with approval by all affected departments. (Coordination will be via signature on current APS submitted for change; approval authority is DFVR.)  M9 - T20 Drops which are in the best interest of the Academy and the cadet will be allowed in select circumstances.  Cadets must have Advisor, AIC, and Course Director coordination with final approval by the major’s Department Head.  Coordination will be via signature on current APS submitted for change.  Undeclared cadets require Fourth-Class Advisor and Course Director coordination with approval by DFVR. Coordination will be via signed APS.  If drop is approved, a "W" will appear on the official transcript.  M21-T30 A grade will appear on the mid-semester progress report. Cadets academically deficient as a result of this grade will be placed on academic probation and will not be eligible to come off until the end of the semester.  Drop requests must be submitted via an APS coordinated through the Course Director, Fourth-Class Advisor /Advisor, and AIC (for declared cadets).  If drop is approved, a "WP" or "WF" will appear on the official transcript.  DFVR is the final approval authority.  M31-FinalsNo drops will be allowed except in extraordinary circumstances (extended  hospitalization, extended emergency leave, or extenuating occurrences approved by DFW).  Extraordinary circumstances do not include a cadet's academically deficient performance in a course and do not apply to cadets changing their academic programs, even if the course they wish to drop is not required in the cadet's new program. These drops will not be approved solely to remove a deficient grade in the course and must have waiver approval via Academy Form 69 (see Figure 3) approved by DFW. Drops approved in this time period will be reflected on official transcripts as "WP" or "WF."  NOTES: The annotated APS should be delivered electronically to DFVRR by submitting it to dfvr.mail@afacademy.af.edu. The academic advisor or Fourth-Class Advisor and cadet keep one copy of the annotated APS.  If the requested change does not create a graduation check failure, the requesting cadet receives a new schedule via the COMPASS webpage. If the change creates a graduation check failure or  if other errors are detected, DFVR will contact the cadet’s advisor for review, clarification, or further adjustments. Cadets must attend all courses until receipt of a new schedule via the COMPASS webpage.  Some offerings of Calculus II, Calculus III, Differential Equations, and Chemistry II vary from the Course Drop Schedule due to grade protection.  For courses shorter than 40 lessons, the drop periods scale with course length.  For example, with a 20-lesson course, drops by lesson T4 leave no record, drops between lessons M5-T10 result in a "W" on the transcript, and drops after Lesson 10 result in a “WP” or “WF” grade.  Course drops after the term ends are at the discretion of the Vice Dean for Academics.  2-2.9. WAIVERS/SUBSTITUTIONS   Use the Academy Form 69, Request for Academic Waiver (see Figure 4).  When cadets request substitute courses for core or academic program requirements, their advisors must specify the requirements as listed on the cadets’ Grad Checks. Advisors must also list the term in which the substitutes will be or have been taken.  When a cadet requests a change to the approved core sequencing found in Section 2-8, the cadet must obtain the signature of the department head of the course delayed.  An APS and Grad Check must be submitted with the Academy Form 69.  The advisor completes the appropriate portions of the form and signs it.  The AIC initials approval of the form and submits it to the appropriate department head for signature.  The form is delivered electronically to DFVR, via dfvr.mail@afacademy.af.edu, who ensures the form has been completed correctly and processes the form through the final approval authority.

Academic Waiver Request, USAF Academy Form 69 	2-2.10. INDEPENDENT STUDY COURSES 	  Cadets can be enrolled in independent study courses for future semesters on-line through COMPASS.  An Academy Form O-498, Request for Permission to Enroll in an Independent Study Course (Figure 5), should be submitted to DFVRR by Lesson 3 of the semester with the independent study.  Fourth-class cadets will not be allowed to enroll in an independent study course.  Third-class cadets can enroll in an independent study course with Department Head approval.  Independent Study courses are numbered as follows: 499 is a 3.0 semester hour course; 499A is a 2.0 semester hour course; 499B is a 1.5 semester hour course; and 499C is a 1.0 semester hour course. The independent study syllabus, appropriately tailored for the student and subject,  will outline the course goals, policies, and expectations. Independent Study courses are unscheduled; DFW is the waiver authority for any special independent study scheduling requests.   Title of Independent Study Courses.  The title of an independent study course, submitted on the Academy Form O-498, should be short and succinct.  Limit the title to 30 characters, since the title or its abbreviation will appear on the cadet's official transcript.  Except in special circumstances, which the requestor should explain, the title should be different from any assigned to other cadets.  No cadet may take an independent study course during the summer term without permission from DFW, coordinated through DFVR.  Limit of Independent Study Courses Taken. You may apply up to six semester hours of  independent study to academic graduation requirements without Department Head approval.  A cadet may take only three semester hours of independent study in any semester. /Figure 5. Request for Permission to Enroll in an Independent Study, USAF Academy Form O-498 2-2.11.  SPECIAL TOPICS COURSES   Special Topics Courses (495s) must be identified at least one semester in advance to DFVR.  Notification should include a course description, section size, enrollment restrictions, prerequisites/co-requisites, and a list of students to enroll if already selected. Unless otherwise  approved, special topics courses are worth three semester hours and require one contact hour.  Special topics courses will be listed in the COI Handbook Supplement published the semester before the course is taught. Each academic discipline can offer one 495 special topics course each semester.  In addition, Department Heads should clearly indicate if third-class cadets will be allowed to enroll in the course. Fourth-class cadets cannot enroll in special topics courses without DFW approval, coordinated through DFVR.  Deviations from this standard may be approved by the Vice Dean for Academics for scenarios that support improvement of department’s curriculum without risk to current offerings.  2-2.12.  AUDITING   Upper-class cadets may audit a non-core course if they have at least a 2.60 cumulative GPA.  An audited course will not count toward minimum course load requirements but does factor into maximum course load requirements.  Cadets must fulfill the 3.25 GPA requirement if they exceed their maximum course loads by adding a course for audit.  A cadet must have the approval of the appropriate Department Head to audit a course.  The Department Head or the instructor has the option of refusing an audit request.  A cadet may not take a course for credit at any time after receiving formal approval to audit the class and after attending one period in an audit status.  Class attendance will be optional for an audited course.  The auditor need only do minimum preparation for the audited course. An auditor will not  participate in graded exercises or assignments.  If an instructor feels an auditing cadet is detracting from the instructor's effectiveness, the instructor may direct the cadet to withdraw from the course.  Cadets may only request permission to audit a course after receiving their class schedules.  A cadet’s class schedule will not be rearranged to allow the cadet to audit a course.  Cadets will submit an audit request letter IAW Figure 6.  Upon completing the request letter, cadets return it to DFVRR for processing and filing.  The audited course will not appear on the cadet's transcript. /Figure 6. Request to Audit an Academic Course  SECTION 2-3 SCHEDULING  2-3.1.  THE ACADEMIC WEEK   The academic week in the fall and spring semesters generally consists of five days with six 53minute periods each.  For scheduling purposes, alternate weekdays are designated as "M" and "T" days during each semester. Each two-day block (one "M" day and one "T" day) is a complete  Lesson.  2-3.2.  ACADEMIC COURSE SCHEDULING   DFVRR prepares the Schedule of Classes for each semester using course offering data, department inputs (via the Preferred Course Offering Information (PCOI) process), and cadet registration information.  Each department scheduling coordinator will provide updated course file data (e.g., type of sectioning, whether or not course will be giving final exams) to DFVRR upon request.  2-3.3. IMPLICATIONS OF CLASS ABSENCES Cadets must be present for duty (attend scheduled classes) unless excused by a proper authority or higher priority event as established in USAFAI 36-3536. Academic contact time with qualified faculty is a key component of maintaining the Academy's higher education accreditation. Regardless of reason for absences, for courses with semester hour credit, the Department Head responsible for administering the course has the authority to direct withdrawal of a cadet from a course if the cadet misses more than 25% of the class meetings (e.g. greater than 10 Lessons of a 40 Lesson course, 3 Lessons of a 10 Lesson course, or 2 Lessons of a 8 Lesson course). On directed withdrawal, the Department Head will 1) assign a “W” or “WP” withdrawal grade based on paragraph 2.3-6 of this handbook, and 2) notify the cadet of the opportunity to appeal the withdrawal. If a cadet is withdrawn from a DF course for this reason, the Vice Dean for Academics is the appeal authority to reinstate the cadet into the course for that semester.  2-3.4.  CADET EXCUSAL FROM ACADEMIC TIME   Department Heads may excuse cadets from a class taught by their departments to visit specific places or agencies in the cadet duty area to perform academic research or work related to specific academic courses.  When the department desires to sponsor an event which will use time, other than the departmentally scheduled academic time, or will require cadets to depart the cadet area, the department must submit an electronic Scheduling Committee Action (SCA) request in COMPASS through their department representative at least two weeks prior to the event.  You can find additional information concerning excusal and compensatory time in the Academy Instruction 36-3536.  2-3.5.  FINAL EXAMINATIONS   The Academy Board specifies the end-of-semester final examination period.  DFVRR schedules end-of-semester final examination times and places for all courses that indicate a final examination requirement, as shown in this handbook and in the COMPASS course catalog.  Final examination periods will not be used for cadets to brief findings on course projects.  Final examination periods must be used solely for written final examinations.  A portion of foreign language final exams may include an oral proficiency evaluation.  The final examination must be at least two hours in length and account for at least 25% of the course grade.  Requests for changes to an individual cadet's final examination schedule must be submitted to DFVRR for approval before the published deadline advertised each semester.  DFVRR coordinates with chapel personnel to accommodate specific religious worship times during final exam scheduling.  English-as-a-Second Language (ESL) cadets eligible for extra time in final examinations must coordinate with individual instructors.  If the extra time given requires rearranging other finals, the cadet must contact DFVRR for rescheduling.  2-3.6.  THE SUMMER   During the fall semester, DFVRC will publish a list of the upcoming summer academic course offerings.  These courses can be found on the DFVR website.  Summer Programs (para 2-6.13) provides further information regarding summer programs. 2-3.7.  ACADEMIC DAY SCHEDULE OF CALLS  A cadet's academic schedule reflects M-day and T-day information.  The academic periods are (from the Academy Cadet Wing Schedule of Calls):  0600-0723 CW TIME 0730-0823 1ST  PERIOD ACADEMICS 0745-0900 PHY ED PERIOD 0830-0923 2ND  PERIOD ACADEMICS 0930-1023 3RD  PERIOD ACADEMICS 0945-1100 PHY ED PERIOD 1030-1123 4TH  PERIOD ACADEMICS 1130-1223 NOON MEAL 1230-1323 M-Days: CW Time, T-Days: DF Time 1330-1423    5TH  PERIOD ACADEMICS 1345-1500 PHY ED PERIOD 1430-1523 6TH  PERIOD ACADEMICS  A cadet’s academic schedule reflects the day (M or T) and period(s) (e.g. M1-M2, T4) during which each course on the schedule is assigned.  The cadet schedule also provides semester hours awarded for course, the location, and the instructor.  All 10-Lesson courses will begin on Lessons 1 (A/E blocks), 11 (B/F blocks), 21 (C/G blocks) or 31 (D/H blocks).  All 20-Lesson courses will begin on Lesson 1 or Lesson 21 (the latter denoted with the “X” suffix in the course identifier, e.g. Leadership 400X).  Phy Ed and CE classes are taught across 8 Lessons within the confines of the designated block. The Academy/AD will publish the start and end dates of each PE ‘go’ prior to the start of each semester. All other classes begin on Lesson 1.  Additional suffixes that may appear on a schedule, but that do not affect the start date of the class, include “H” for honors sections. “Z” for experimental sections, “FR” for fourth-class cadet only sections of upper-level classes, and “S” for sections that count toward the Martinson Honors Program Academy Scholar designation.   2-3.8.  COURSES WITH UNUSUAL SCHEDULES Airmanship, Aviation, Leadership, and Space.  During the fall and spring semesters, various Airmanship, Aviation, Leadership, and Space courses are taught in ten- or twentyLesson blocks with two or more consecutive contact hours. Many of these are overscheduled with one another or with Phy Ed Courses.  Pseudo Courses.  Phy Ed 8xx and 9xx are pseudo courses scheduled for 1st, 2nd, 5th, and/or 6th  period.  Intercollegiate athletes are enrolled in these courses to block out Phy Ed time.  Ext Prog 7XX is a pseudo course that blocks out one or more academic periods for scheduling purposes.  Eight/Ten Lesson Block Courses.  Courses that meet for 8- or 10-Lesson blocks (Phy Ed, Armnshp and Leadership) are identified with the following suffix (see Table 6 below).    Table 12. Block Schedules Fall       Spring Block Lessons Block Lessons A M1 – T10 E M1 – T10 B M11 – T20 F M11 – T20 C M21 – T30 G M21 – T30 D M31 – T40 H M31 – T40  Twenty Lesson Block Courses.  Various classes (e.g. Comm Strt 101/101X, Armnshp 302/302X) meet for 20 Lessons.  Courses with no suffix indicate the cadet will attend Lessons 1 through 20; courses with the X suffix will attend Lessons 21 through 40.  Table 13.

Experimental courses are courses testing new instructional material.  They are identified on the cadet’s schedule by a "Z" suffix.  Learning Strategies 101 (Learning Strategies for Academic and Career Success). A course  	 administered by the Academic Success Center (DFVRL) in the fall for fourth-class cadets identified as "academically at-risk."  Other cadets are welcome to take this course.    Learning Strategies 102: A condensed version of the Learning Strategies 101 course. It is  offered once in the spring and once in the fall after mid-semester grades are released.  Communication Strategies 101/101X.  Introduction to Communication.  This 20-Lesson, half-semester course develops reading and communication skills to support success in academic, professional, and intercultural contexts. Students engage with core academic texts and practice evidence-based communication strategies. Cadets may enroll in Comm Strt 101 (first 20 Lessons of the semester) or Comm Strt 101X (second 20 Lessons of the semester).  Double-Period Courses.  Only valid laboratory or other approved courses may be doubleperiod courses. Valid double-period academic core courses with three semester hours of credit may include up to 10 syllabus-specified laboratory periods in a given semester.  Other Lessons must end at 53 minutes.  100-level foreign language courses are exempt from this policy and therefore may include up to 40 laboratory periods per semester.  Non-core double-period courses are not affected by this policy and may include up to 40 laboratory periods per semester.  Excusal Codes.   Intercollegiate excusal codes help schedulers block out time in cadets’ schedules for participation in the appropriate athletic activities.  The most common codes are intercollegiate practice time M afternoon (Phy Ed 816 or Phy Ed 916) or T afternoon (Phy Ed 826 or Phy Ed 926).  Other excusal codes are used to block out time during the academic day for designated cadet senior leadership to accomplish their job duties.   2-3.9.  MINIMUM ENROLLMENT SIZE FOR MAJORS AND CLASSES At least 12 graduates per major are expected to graduate yearly.  If the number of graduates in a major falls below 12 yearly for two successive years, the major is placed on a warning list.  After three more successive years with an average of less than 12 graduates in the major, the major will be eliminated from the curriculum unless the Dean of the Faculty approves an academic waiver.  Minimum enrollment for any course, excluding independent study courses, is six cadets.  No course will be taught with fewer than six cadets without a waiver from the Vice Dean for Academics. SECTION 2-4 GRADING  2-4.1.  GRADES AND QUALITY POINTS   A cadet's performance in any graded course of instruction is officially reported to DFVR at midsemester and end-of-semester or summer term as one of the following grades:  A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, F, WP, WF, and I (discussed in special grades, para 2.3-6).  Deficient grades include C-, D and F.  Following is a list of grades, their quality points (QP), and course quality points.  Table 15.

GRADES   Final grades are awarded at the end of the semester and are reflected on each cadet's official transcript.  Mid-term grades are awarded after Lesson T20 but are not recorded on a transcript.  Departments must ensure mid-term grades are worth 25% or more of courses' final grades.  During summer academics and summer training programs, final grades are awarded one week after the course concludes.  During all final grading cycles, semester and cumulative Grade Point Averages (GPA), Military Performance Averages (MPA), and Physical Education Averages (PEA) are recomputed and appear on each cadet's personal grade report.  2-4.3.  DEPARTED CADET GRADE ASSIGNMENTS   Periodically, between final grading cycles, cadets permanently depart the Academy.  Upon their departure, DFVR requests final grade assignments from each department in which the cadet was enrolled.  2-4.4.  GRADE CHANGES   Grade changes should be sent to DFVRR as expeditiously as possible so that cadet records can be updated.  All grade changes are accomplished IAW the Academy Instruction 36-3542, Assigning and Processing Formal Grades, and should be signed by the appropriate Department Head as depicted in Figure 7.   / Figure 7. Grade Change Request Letter  2-4.5.  ACADEMIC APPELLATE PROCEDURE  A cadet may appeal a grade or other academic issue directly to the instructor and course director.  If the matter is not resolved satisfactorily to the cadet, the cadet may appeal in writing to the Department Head concerned, stating specific objections.  Under the Academy Instruction 36-3542, Assigning and Processing Formal Grades, Department Heads maintain ultimate responsibility for assignment of and changes to letter grades.  Normally, the Department Head’s decision is final.  In appropriate cases, the Dean of the Faculty may request the appropriate Division Chair review the appeal case for overall fairness, consistency, and appropriateness, and make recommendations to the Dean of the Faculty for final resolution.  2-4.6.  SPECIAL GRADES   The cadet’s official transcript, mid-semester grade report, or the end-of-semester grade report may contain the following notations: P (passing), W (withdrawn), WP (withdrawn passing), WF (withdrawn failing), IC (incomplete controllable—a grade indicating questionable status in a course), and IU (incomplete uncontrollable).  These grades carry no quality points and are not used in computing any GPA.  A "P" grade is awarded when a cadet is satisfactorily performing or has satisfactorily completed a Pass/Fail course.  A "W" grade is awarded when a cadet withdraws from a course between Lesson M9 and Lesson T20.  If a cadet drops a full-semester course after T20, the department concerned awards the cadet a "WP" or "WF" grade, as appropriate. The academic department has three working days from the time of notification that the cadet has withdrawn from the course to forward the awarded grade to DFVRR. If the cadet completed the course requirements before  the end of the semester (e.g., a course that has no final exam), the department will submit a final grade to DFVRR.  An “IC” or “IU” grade is a temporary grade given at the end of the semester, or a penalty grade given at a progress report.  “IC” or “IU” grades indicate a cadet's questionable status in a course.  "IC" or “IU” grades may be awarded in graded courses as well as in pass/fail courses.  They may be “controllable” or “uncontrollable” incomplete grades.  It is the cadet’s responsibility to coordinate with instructor(s) to resolve any “IU” or “IC” grades prior to the next grading cycle.  For instance, incomplete grades awarded at the end of the fall semester should be resolved by spring mid-semester grade submission. Incomplete grades awarded at the end of the spring should be resolved by end of summer grade submission.  The waiver authority to approve additional time to resolve incomplete grades is the Department Head for the course with the incomplete grade, to include notification to DFVR.  If a cadet does not complete the coursework within the allotted time or receive an extension for additional time, the department awards a final grade, as appropriate, based on the completed and unfinished work in the course.  When “IC” or “IU” grades are cleared and all course work is completed, a permanent grade will be assigned.  DFVRR must be notified immediately of the grade change so that all cadet records associated with a grade change (i.e., transcripts, APSs, GPAs, Honor Lists) can be updated.  If a cadet is out processing, “IC” or “IU” grades must be resolved prior to departure.  Uncontrollable incomplete “IU” grades indicate that work has not been completed for causes outside the control of the cadet, such as medical incapacity or emergency.  Mid-semester:  Uncontrollable incomplete work for full-semester courses at the mid-semester report will be awarded an “IU” grade and will not place a cadet on academic probation.  End-of-Semester:  Uncontrollable incomplete work will be monitored by the department awarding the “IU” grade and will be completed at the earliest opportunity.  The cadet is not placed on restriction or academic probation solely for this “IU” grade.  An uncontrollable incomplete grade, pending an extension by the Department Head, should be resolved by the next grading cycle, but must be resolved before graduation.  Controllable incomplete “IC” grades indicate the cadet was responsible for failure to complete an assignment.  Controllable causes include cadet's failure to complete an assignment considered to be important for evaluating course work.  Mid-semester:  Controllable incomplete “IC” grade indicates that for reasons within  the control of the cadet, work has not been completed.  Cadets in this situation will be placed on academic probation for the next grading period.  End-of-Semester:  Cadets earning controllable incomplete grades will be restricted to the Academy through finals (applies to cadets earning "IC" grades in courses with no final exam). If incomplete work is completed by the end of finals, a grade will be  awarded, and the cadet will not be placed on academic probation solely due to the "IC" grade.  If incomplete work is not completed by the end of finals, the department issuing the "IC" may assign a final letter grade IAW the Academy Instruction 36-3542, Assigning and Processing Formal Grades, or allow the cadet to carry the incomplete into the next semester.  It is highly encouraged that departments issue a final fall semester grade for all first-class cadets before Lesson 3 of the spring semester.  Firstclass cadets may need to add or retake a course to meet graduation requirements.  Any cadet with an outstanding controllable incomplete grade at the end of a semester will be placed on academic probation and will be subject to academic disenrollment.  A controllable incomplete grade, pending an extension by the Department Head, should be resolved by the next grading cycle, but must be resolved before graduation.  Grade assignments for 10- or 20-Lesson block pass/fail courses.  The following provides guidelines for assignment of grades to cadets who are disenrolled from Airmanship or other 10- or 20-Lesson block pass/fail courses. If the cadet withdraws from a course before the  completion of all course requirements, the following criteria will be used in assignment of pass/fail grades:  If the cadet completed 5 or fewer of the 10 or 20 required Lessons, assign a "W."  If the cadet completed at least 6 Lessons but less than the entire course, assign either a "WP" or a "WF."  If the cadet completed the entire 10- or 20-Lesson course, assign either a passing "P" or failing "F" grade.    2-4.7.  TRANSFER AND VALIDATION CREDIT   No quality points are awarded for transfer or validation credit.  All transfer and validation credits may be applied toward graduation requirements, providing that the cadet completes a minimum of 125 semester hours in residence.  DFVR enters transfer/validation credit into a cadet’s record after being informed, in writing, by the academic department/agency responsible for the applicable course, following the format depicted in Figure 8.  (1) Transfer/validation credit.  Cadets who attended another college or university or who validate courses may earn validation or transfer credit that is included in the total semester hour count.  The appropriate department, dependent on the subject matter or discipline, will review materials (transcript, syllabus, textbook, etc.) to determine whether Academy transfer credit is appropriate for the coursework completed at another college or university. DFVR will maintain the transcript in the cadet’s record for any coursework approved for transfer credit.  If cadets leave the Academy prior to Lesson 9 of their first semester, transfer/validation credit will not appear on their Academy transcripts.  A cadet who is readmitted following disenrollment or resignation may be given transfer or validation credit for courses taken while away from the Academy.  If the transfer or validation credit is for a course previously taken and failed at the Academy and subsequently repeated at another college or university, the transfer/validation credit should fill the course requirement on the grad check and the ‘F’ grade will be listed under "Other Courses Taken" for active cadets; the ‘F’ grade continues to count in the cumulative GPA.  Credit (grades and corresponding quality points) will be accepted for courses completed with a proficient grade at the Academy by the Academy Preparatory School cadets upon entering the Academy. If a Cadet Candidate from the Academy  Preparatory School receives a deficient grade, the cadet will be withdrawn from the course.  Phy Ed courses can be transferred from other universities, particularly for cadets on semester exchange to foreign military academies and sister service academies.  Regardless of the total number of Phy Ed courses transferred, a minimum of eight  the Academy Phy Ed courses must be taken and counted toward graduation requirements.  Chemistry Initial Placement and Major Declaration.  Transfer credit, validation credit, and placement into Chem 100 or Chem 200 in the fall or spring will be based on college transcripts and AP scores, as well as a survey of incoming cadets.  Cadets completing Chem 100 in the fourth-class fall and interested in declaring chemistry, biology, or pursuing a pre-med track should be placed into Chem 200 in the fourth-class spring.  Cadets with a strong interest in chemistry are encouraged to declare early (NLT spring fourth-class year).  Depending upon validation and transfer credit, cadets interested in chemistry should be placed in Chemistry 233 (Organic Chemistry I) in the fall of their third-class year.  Incoming cadets who score well on placement exams, receive acceptable scores on AP and/or IB exams, or who have previously received college credit for certain core and upper-level classes may receive validation or transfer credit for those classes.  Placement Exams are completed by incoming cadets prior to or during Basic Cadet Training and determine the core math and foreign language classes in which they are placed during their fourth-class year. Cadets placing into advanced courses (e.g. Math 152, Spanish 221) will receive validation credit for the preceding classes (e.g. Math 141, Spanish 131 and 132).  AP/IB scores should be automatically delivered to the Academy during the summer of cadets’ incoming year and are used to award validation credit as appropriate (see Table 16). Students who feel they have not been awarded appropriate credit, typically because the scores were not sent to the Academy, can provide their test scores to DFVR for evaluation.  (iii)Transfer credit may be awarded for students who have completed post-secondary coursework comparable to the class for which credit is being sought from an accredited university.  Transcripts should be sent to the Academy as part of the application and appointment acceptance process; however, missing transcripts can be forwarded to DFVR.  The owning department of the class for which transfer credit is being requested will evaluate the course, sometimes requesting additional information such as a course syllabus, and will notify DFVR if transfer credit should be awarded validation credit based on AP (College Board) and IB (International Baccalaureate) testing is in accordance with the table below:  Table 16.

Award of Course Transfer or Validation Credit Request Letter  2-4.8.  GRADE POINT AVERAGE   A cadet's semester and cumulative GPAs are determined by dividing the total quality points earned in all graded courses by the total semester hours attempted.  DFVRR publishes semester and cumulative GPAs to the nearest .01 for each mid-semester and end-of-semester grade report.  When a cadet repeats a course, the GPA is recomputed as follows:  The cumulative GPA is adjusted with the previous grade being replaced by the most recent grade.  Up to 13 semester hours may be replaced in the cumulative GPA in this manner, but all grades will remain on the transcript. If a cadet repeats more than 13 semester hours of  courses, the grades for all additional courses repeated will not replace the previous grades but will be calculated into the cumulative GPA along with the previous grade.  Courses that can be used to replace a grade also include core substitutes (e.g., Math 300 replacing Math 356), 100-level foreign language courses (e.g., Portuguese 132 replacing Arabic 132), and intermediate core science basket courses (e.g., Biology 215 replacing Physics 215).  Cadets and academic advisors should verify that courses used for grade replacement also fulfill graduation check requirements for the current/new academic major/program.  If a course is repeated in the same semester (i.e. a Phy Ed or Leadership course), grade replacement will reflect in the semester GPA computations. For cadets who repeat a failed spring course in the summer, the repeated grade will replace the original grade in the combined Spring/Summer semester GPA and for all other end-of-summer GPA computations. The cadet will remain on academic probation if the combined Spring/Summer semester GPA is below a 2.0 or for any other unresolved issues which contribute to academic probation.  Students must have a passing grade to replace an "F" grade in the cumulative GPA.  If a repeat "F" grade is earned, both "F" grades will count in the GPAs.  When a cadet takes a course for a third time and receives a passing grade, the newest grade will replace only the grade from the second attempt; the grade from the first attempt will remain factored into the cumulative GPA.  The semester GPA will include the grades of courses taken that semester, regardless of whether or not the course was taken previously or was subsequently repeated.  When considering whether or not to repeat a passed course, a cadet must note that it is the most recent grade, not necessarily the best grade that is computed in the GPA.  2-4.9.  MAJOR’S and CORE GPA   The major's GPA includes grades for courses designated by the Department Head responsible for that major, regardless of whether or not the course is being used to satisfy a major’s requirement.  Courses which count toward the major’s GPA are annotated by an ‘M1’ (‘M2’ for a second major) on the academic graduation check.  The core GPA includes grades for any course which has been approved to fill a core requirement per the curriculum for that class year, regardless of whether or not the course is being used to satisfy a core requirement.   2-4.10.  OVERALL PERFORMANCE AVERAGE (OPA) The graduation class standing is based on cadet cumulative Overall Performance Average (OPA). To earn Distinguished Graduate designation, a cadet must be in the top 10% of OPA and also be in the top 50% of cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), cumulative Military Performance Average (CMPA), and cumulative Physical Education Average (CPEA) for their class year. The Academy Board can extend, at its discretion, below the top 10% of cadets by OPA to identify the top 10% of cadets who meet the criteria of being in the top 50% of CGPA, CMPA, and CPEAs as Distinguished Graduates.   OPA is calculated using the following algorithm. First, CGPA, CMPA, and CPEA are individually standardized to create GPA*, MPA*, and PEA*. Second, OPA* is calculated as the weighted combination of GPA*, MPA*, and PEA*.  OPA* = 50% GPA* + 40% MPA* + 10% PEA*  For the calculation of OPA, Phy Ed grades are removed from CGPA since they are included in CPEA. Finally, OPA is calculated by normalizing OPA* with a mean of 3 and a standard deviation of 0.33.  This algorithm can result in OPA being higher or lower than CGPA, CMPA, and/or CPEA.  2-4.11.  GRADUATION RECOGNITION  The following recognitions are determined by the Academy Board prior to graduation.   Table 17. Graduation Honors RECOGNITION Distinguished Graduate With "Academic Distinction" With "Military Distinction" With "Athletic Distinction" Academy Scholar GRADUATING CLASS 	BASED ON 	Up to top 10% 	(OPA) 	Top 10% 	(GPA) 	Top 10% 	(MPA) 	Top 10% 	(PEA) Meet Martinson Honors Program requirements  2-4.12.  HONOR LIST REQUIREMENTS Any probation or honor rehabilitation precludes placement on an honor list. For cadets on exchange or study abroad refer to section 2-4.13.   Dean’s List. Cadets who earn a semester GPA of at least 3.0 in academic courses (while taking at least the minimum courseload) will be on the Dean's list.  These cadets are authorized to wear the Dean's pin on their uniform for the next semester.  Physical Education grades are not included in Dean's list calculations.  It is possible for a cadet to have a semester GPA over 3.0 and still not be on the Dean's list if the Phy Ed grades pulled the GPA over 3.0.  Likewise, it is possible for a cadet to have a semester GPA slightly less than 3.0 and be on the Dean's list if the Phy Ed grades were low.  Also note that only the semester GPA determines the Dean's list.  Therefore, cadets cannot be placed on the Dean's list based on Prog (mid-semester) grades or Cum GPA.  However, cadets may be removed from the Dean's list at Prog if their midsemester grades put them on academic probation.  Summer grades are not included in Dean’s list calculations.  Athletic Director’s List.  Cadets who earn a semester Physical Education Average (PEA) of at least 3.0 will be on the Athletic Director’s list.  These cadets are authorized to wear the Athletic Director’s pin on their uniform for the next semester.  PEA is a weighted 4.0 grading scale (50% Physical Fitness Test + 35% Phy Ed course grades + 15% Aerobic Fitness Test).  Commandant’s List.  Cadets in the top third of their class year by semester MPA will be on the Commandant’s list.  These cadets are authorized to wear the Commandant’s pin on their uniform for the next semester.  Superintendent’s List.  Cadets who earn semester performance averages (GPA, PEA, and MPA) to merit placement on the Dean’s, Athletic Director’s, and Commandant’s lists will be on the Superintendent’s list.  These cadets are authorized to wear the Superintendent’s pin on their uniform for the next semester.  2-4.13.  EXCHANGE PROGRAM GRADES For the Academy cadets participating in study abroad and exchange programs, the following guidelines apply for the awarding of course credit and grades from their semester away from the Academy.   Service Academy Exchange Program (SAEP): cadets receive the letter grades awarded on their sister service academy transcript, consistent with our grading scale.   Cadet Semester Study Abroad Program/Cadet Semester Exchange Abroad Program (CSSAP/CSEAP): cadets receive Pass/Fail grades from their semester away from the Academy, consistent with the grade earned at the supporting institution.   For cadets on an exchange or study abroad program, Academy coursework completed while away from the Academy, with an Academy faculty member, can be awarded as a Pass/Fail grade or as a letter grade at the discretion of the academic department.  Cadets returning from an exchange program or study abroad can be placed on the Dean’s list provided they earned USAFA letter grades (A-F) for their equivalent coursework and provided they completed a minimum of 14.5 semester hours with a GPA at or above 3.0.   In accordance with ADOI 36-3504, cadets returning from exchange or study abroad can be placed on the Athletic Director’s list for the exchange semester based on a cumulative PEA at or above 3.0.   In accordance with USAFAI 36-2001, cadets will not receive an MPA nor be eligible for the Commandant’s list for the semester they are absent from the Academy; their cumulative MPA will roll forward to serve as their semester MPA for the semester spent on exchange or study abroad.   SECTION 2-5 ACADEMIC DEFICIENCY AND PROBATION  2-5.1.  ACADEMIC DEFICIENCY A cadet is deficient in studies at the mid-semester progress report or the end of a semester/summer term under the following conditions:  A grade of "F" or a controllable incomplete "IC" grade in one or more courses, whether graded or pass/fail.  A grade of “F” in a Phy Ed course, by itself, does not place a cadet on academic probation.  In addition, a previous grade of “F” or “IC” in a core academic course which has not been repeated with a passing grade, either at mid-semester progress or end of a term, results in academic probation.   Semester, core, and/or cumulative GPAs less than 2.0.  Semester, core, and cumulative GPAs include all graded courses.  Deficiencies in core GPA will not be tracked for academic probation (ACPRO) status until a cadet’s 4th  semester.  First-class cadets are deficient and will be placed on academic probation if their majors’ GPAs are less than 2.0.  Academic Review Committees (ARCs) review cadets in the following categories:  Cadets whose academic records meet any one of the following criteria are considered to be seriously deficient in academics.  The ARCs review those cadets’ records to determine if the cadets should be recommended for disenrollment or if any other appropriate action is necessary.  Multiple Failures.  More than one "F" grade in one semester.  Very Low GPA.  A GPA considered being seriously deficient and warranting special consideration by the ARC.  Very Low GPAs may be either semester or cumulative and vary by semester as shown below.  Table 18. Academic Deficiency - "Very Low GPA"  SEMESTER SEM GPA LESS THAN CUM GPA LESS THAN CUM CORE GPA LESS THAN 1 1.50 1.50  2 1.50 1.70  3 1.50 1.80  4 1.50 1.90 2.00 5 1.50 1.95 2.00 6 1.60 2.00 2.00 7 1.70 2.00 2.00 8 or later 1.80 2.00 2.00  Repeat Failure. Repeat failure ("F" grade) in the same course, whether core or  elective and regardless of the number of semester hours.  Two sequential semesters of either low or very low semester and/or cumulative GPA.   Failure to achieve a 2.0 semester or cumulative GPA in 3 sequential semesters.  Multiple deficient semesters. Third-class cadets who were deficient three of their first four semesters.  Multiple Probations.  Deficient in academics and aptitude, conduct, honor, and/or athletic performance.  Low GPA Review.  Any cadet whose academic record meets any of the following criteria is considered to be deficient in academics:  Semester, core, and/or cumulative GPA less than 2.0 but greater than the GPA defined in paragraph 2-4.1b(1)(b).  For first-class cadets, a major’s GPA less than 2.0.  Single "F" grade.  One "F" grade in an academic major, core, or elective course. “WF” (withdrawn failing) grades do not result in academic probation.  Controllable incomplete "IC" grade. Willful incompletion of a course requirement.   2-5.2.  PLACEMENT ON ACADEMIC PROBATION The guiding directive for academic probation is the Academy Instruction 36-3523, Review and Disposition of Deficient Cadets.    All academically deficient cadets will be placed on academic probation at mid-semester, end-of-semester, or at the end of the third summer term if they attended summer academics.  Cadets are effectively on academic probation from the date of publication of a progress report on which they are deficient as described in paragraph 2-5.1.    Squadron Commanders are responsible for pulling their cadet squadron’s probation report from COMPASS immediately after mid-semester grades are released and at the beginning of each semester.      2-5.3.  ACADEMIC PROBATION POLICIES The following are roles, responsibilities, and expectations of cadets, advisors, and Squadron Commanders to fulfill the requirements of academic probation.  Cadets placed on academic probation must submit by email a fully coordinated Academy Form 68 to their Squadron Commander, Academic Advisor, Cadet Academic Officer (CADO), and ARC Coordinator within 10 days of being placed on probation at mid-semester, within 10 days of the beginning of a new semester, or as directed by the Academic Review Committee.   Probationary cadets are expected to work with their cadet chain of command, CADO, Academic Advisor, and Squadron Commander to complete the Form 68. The purpose of the Academy Form 68 is to identify precisely why a cadet is failing to perform academically, develop a plan of action to counteract the reasons identified, to determine if the cadet is motivated to make the necessary changes, and to capture the commitment of the cadet’s support structure.  Probationary cadets are expected to take responsibility for their academic deficiency, seek counsel, and to work hard towards academic EXCELLENCE, not simply towards becoming marginally proficient.   Probationary cadets are primarily responsible for proactively completing the Academy Form 68 on time and seeking academic help. All cadets should check their grades as soon as they are released by DFVR. Cadets are expected to know if they are on probation by reviewing their grades in relation to the deficiency standards in paragraph 2-4.1.  Deficient cadets are on probation and will be reviewed by the Academic Review Committee. Deficient cadets do not need to wait for a probation list to know that they are on probation. Probationary cadets should begin the Form 68 process immediately after grades are released.  Probationary cadets will work with their element, flight, academic cadet staffs, their Academic Advisors, and their Squadron Commanders to design a personalized academic Action Plan that, if followed, ensures the cadet will be on the path towards achieving academic excellence.  Squadron Commanders are responsible for knowing which of their assigned cadets are deficient academically, the key factors causing probationary cadets to fail, and how probationary cadets are going to change to achieve academic excellence.  Squadron Commanders are responsible for pulling a list of probationary cadets from COMPASS and providing a list of cadets on academic probation (AcPro) to the cadet squadron Academic Officer immediately after grades are released by DFVR.  Any delay in providing the AcPro list to the CADO could jeopardize the intended timeline for completing the Academy Form 68.    Squadron Commanders are expected to meet with academically deficient cadets before the Form 68 can be final. The Squadron Commander may direct revisions to the probationary cadet’s evaluation, statement, and action plan. Squadron Commanders are expected to provide  routine oversight of academically deficient cadets and help ensure probationary cadets are following through with their action plans.   Squadron Commanders will work closely with squadron academic officers in developing a squadron academic policy that enables all cadets to achieve academic excellence and to ensure its proper implementation.   Academic Advisors are expected to meet with their probationary advisees shortly after grades are released to provide guidance in identifying factors for academic failure, to discuss the personal change that is required to achieve academic excellence, and to refer the cadet to the appropriate support offered by the Academy.  Academic Advisors are primarily responsible for documenting consultations using the Academy Form 68 in a way that will most benefit the probationary cadet in their pursuit of academic excellence.  Squadron Cadet Academic Officer (CADO) responsibilities.   The Squadron Commander will provide the CADO a list of academically deficient cadets assigned to their squadron on Lessons M1 and M22.  CADOs will meet with all academically deficient cadets individually and help the cadet initiate the Form 68 no later than Lessons M2 and M23.    CADOs provide primary oversight for the completion of the Academy Form 68 within the directed timelines.  Probationary cadets appealing a disenrollment vote by the ARC Records Review may only have 5 days to complete the entire Academy Form 68 process and will require priority over other probationary cadets.    CADOs provide a statement in field 3 of every Academy Form 68 and are required to assign and validate Weekend Academic Call to Quarters (WACQs) as part of every probationary cadet’s action plan. (See additional WACQ guidance in Appendix 3.)  	   CADOs are required to develop squadron academic policies that ensure all cadets can achieve excellence in academics and employ all the resources offered by the Academy to include the Writing Center, Quantitative Reasoning Center, and library.    CADOs are responsible for ensuring military training and other squadron functions do not interfere with a cadet’s ability to achieve academic excellence, to attend Consultations directed in section 5a of the Academy Form 68, or to attend professional tutoring services.   CADOs are responsible for ensuring Academic Call to Quarters is a quiet and studious environment where cadets can achieve academic excellence.   CADOs are responsible for compiling a list of in-squadron academic tutors and for establishing a squadron tutoring plan.  The tutoring plan should be made available to all squadron members (especially fourth-class cadets), provide incentives for tutors to participate, and ensure all cadets benefit from the tutoring offered. Peer tutoring should not take the place of seeking EI, completing Writing Center tutorials, or attending the Quantitative Reasoning Center. The Squadron Tutoring Plan should be developed to complement the resources the Academy professionally offers.  CADOs are responsible for developing a WACQ monitoring program and an incentive policy in coordination with the cadet squadron staff and the Squadron Commander. The incentive policy should encourage probationary cadets to become proactive learners and to seek resources beyond what is prescribed in their Academy Form 68 Action Plans. The monitoring program should require probationary cadets to proactively manage the requirements of and track the progress in their courses on a daily/weekly basis.   Example probationary policy MFR: Academic Probation Policy Template  The purpose of this memorandum is to detail the process by which cadets on academic probation may sign out on weekends after completing the requirements.  The intent of this policy is to replace a blanket restriction with a goal-oriented program that will reward academic efforts on a weekly basis and encourage good academic habits for those on academic probation.  Ideally, this system will encourage lifelong habits, organization, and study skills that will help probationary cadets for the remainder of their cadet and professional careers.  This policy should give academically deficient cadets reasonable and attainable goals while providing opportunities to earn sign-out privileges on a weekly basis.  If the probationary cadet uses the program as intended, they will get in a cycle of being ahead academically and be able to use their weekends to recharge for the next week’s challenges. If at  any point the cadet is not meeting the intentions of this program, they may return to normal probation restricted status and will not be allowed to sign-out on the weekends.    Cadets on academic probation will maintain an academic folder or binder.  It must contain the following information:  the cadet’s academic schedule for the current semester, an up-to-date grade tracker for all classes in which the cadet is currently enrolled, an assignment calendar with timelines for GRs, projects, papers, quizzes, and any other assignments that will have an impact on the cadet’s current grades, a record of all counseling documents related to academic probation, and a completed academic action plan (Academy Form 68).  2-5.4.  REMOVAL FROM ACADEMIC PROBATION Cadets will be removed from all conditions of academic probation when their semester, core and cumulative (and major's GPA for first-class cadets) performance meet the minimum GPA of 2.0 with no "F" or controllable incomplete "IC" grades at mid-semester, end-of-semester, or end-ofsummer term report.    Cadets who have not yet repeated, and are not currently repeating, a previously failed core course will remain on academic probation.  Cadets on academic probation at the end of spring semester remain on academic probation through the summer, until the fall mid-semester progress report, unless conditions for probation are corrected by summer academic performance.  Upon completion of summer course work, summer grades will be combined (for determining academic probation status only) with spring semester course work to determine the combined "spring-summer" semester GPAs.  If cumulative and spring-summer combined "semester" GPAs are 2.0 or greater and all failed courses have been repeated and passed, the cadet will be removed from academic probation.    Cadets with outstanding controllable incomplete "IC" grades will remain on academic probation until the grading cycle after the “IC” grade is removed.  Also, cadets will remain on academic probation until they are passing a failed core course.  Cadets will not be removed from academic probation at any time other than indicated above unless they were placed on academic probation through administrative error.  Cadets who drop a course after the mid-semester progress report are not removed from academic probation solely because the deletion of a deficient course "raises" their core, semester or cum GPA.  These cadets remain on academic probation until the end-of-semester progress report.  2-5.5.  ACADEMIC REVIEW COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES Mid-semester ARC.  Each ARC Chair and coordinator will review the records of deficient cadets and may make recommendations or directives to cadets.  No retention/disenrollment voting occurs at mid-semester meetings.  End-of-Semester/Summer ARC.  Full voting membership ARC meetings are held at the end of each semester and at the end of the summer term.  Reviews include all academically deficient cadets.  The ARC recommends cadets for disenrollment, nine semesters, conditional turn back, late graduation, and the Bachelor of Science Program.  The committees will recommend that cadets who are deficient in studies be disenrolled unless it is determined that both overall performance and probability of successful academic program completion justify retention.  Decisions by the ARC to retain cadets are final.  Should the committee decide that a cadet's overall performance and probability of successfully completing an academic program justify retention, it will recommend or direct one or more of the following:  Continue with class.  Seek assistance from appropriate agency.  Underload or drop to a normal load during the current or future semester (See Section 2-2.3).  Remove from advance placement course to lower-level course (coordinate with sponsoring Department Head).  Repeat a course or complete an incomplete grade (See Section 2-4.6d).  Recommend/direct change or drop of major.  Recommend/direct withdrawal from or limit participation in intercollegiate athletics, with coordination through the appropriate eligibility committee and AD.  Withdraw from or limit participation in extracurricular activities.  Recommend/direct withdrawal from or limit participation in military duties, with coordination through the Commandant of Cadets representative.  Be automatically reviewed at a future progress report.  Direct enrollment in summer academics in lieu of summer break.   Any other recommended/directed action appropriate to an individual cadet's case.  2-5.6.  ACADEMIC REVIEW COMMITTEE PREPARATION Committee Coordinator Responsibilities:  Ensure committee members are trained in responsibilities and procedures.  Distribute cadet deficiency reports at each progress report.  Prepare and distribute records review/interview schedules, agendas, and APSs as soon as possible to ARC members and academic departments prior to end-of-semester/summer ARC meetings.  Prepare deficient cadet records and brief them during committee review.  Group and Squadron Commander Responsibility: Squadron Commanders will forward end-of-semester/summer evaluations to the ARC Chair through Group Commanders.  These evaluations will include any data the Commander believes to be significant for ARC decision-making (e.g., suitability for commissioning, Weekend Academic Calls to Quarters (WACQs) assigned/served, probationary status, and personal and medical information).  Academic Advisor/ Fourth-Class Advisor Responsibility:  Under the procedures of USAF Instruction 36-3523, advisors have a significant role.  They function as extensions of the Academic Review Committees.    The ARC requires advisors to oversee cadets in all categories of academic probation in completing the Academy Form 68, Cadet Academic Deficiency Evaluation and Probation Action Plan.  If ARC directives require a scheduling change, an APS must be coordinated as soon as possible.  All cadets on academic probation must be counseled within 10 duty days after the beginning of the following semester and publication of grades.  The Academy Form 68 is the advisor's written statement to the ARC.  Advisors are primary sources of information to the ARC.  Advisors must therefore serve as detectives or diagnosticians and attempt to discover the real causes of poor academic performance.  The following suggestions are useful while preparing an Academy Form 68.  Understand the ARC will look unfavorably on any cadet who has needed Extra Instruction (EI) and can't document that quality EI was sought.  Communicate any directives clearly to the cadet.  Diagnose the problem and assist in developing a specific course of action.  Don’t assume that the cadet's view of his or her level of effort or standing in the course is an objective/realistic one.  When you direct the cadet to see you at specified intervals, make them frequent enough to serve an effective oversight function.  Once a month is too infrequent.  The Academy Form 68 should reflect an individualized plan, since each cadet’s situation is unique and requires personalized attention to ensure academic success.  If the advisor will not be available for the cadet’s appeal interview, they must submit a written comment card, memo for record, or be very clear on the Academy Form 68 as to their retain or disenrollment recommendation and supporting bullets.  In addition, the advisor must ensure another advisor from the same academic department can advise the cadet through the appeal process and during the appeal interview.  Academically Deficient Cadet Responsibilities: Deficient cadets will complete an Academy Form 68 according to the instructions and submit it to their academic advisor within 10 duty days after the publication of progress reports.  Exception: Cadets recommended for disenrollment must complete an Academy Form 68 with their appeal package if they intend to appeal the recommendation.  If cadets fail to complete an Academy Form 68 and deliver it to their academic advisor by the established deadline date, the academic advisor will initiate coordination with the Squadron Commander and squadron cadet academic officer.  Instructor Responsibilities:  Mid-semester.  The ARC requires instructors to complete computerized comment cards for all cadets who earned C-, D, and F grades in their course.  End-of-Semester. The ARC requires instructors to complete computerized comment  cards for all cadets who earned C-, D, and F grades in their courses and for all cadets listed on ARC comment card rosters.  End-of-Semester ARC Interviews. Instructors may choose to complete a letter of  recommendation for cadets who elect to appeal an ARC disenrollment recommendation.  Granting a cadet's request for a letter is an instructor prerogative, not a requirement.  End-of-Summer Term.  The ARC requires all academic instructors to complete a comment card on cadets who have earned a final C-, D, or F grade in their courses and for any additional cadets, as requested by the ARC.  Instructors must submit comment cards to the Summer Academics Program coordinator in DFVRC no later than two days after the last day of summer term classes.  Medical Staff Responsibilities.  The medical representative will review the medical records of cadets appealing a disenroll recommendation.  The medical representative need not be present at committee meetings, but if there is significant medical information, either written or verbal comments need to be prepared for the committee.  A negative reply to the coordinator prior to committee meetings is required.  Athletic Representative Responsibilities.  The athletic representative will review the athletic and physical education records of all reviewed cadets.   2-5.7.  ACADEMIC REVIEW COMMITTEE PROCEDURES Although ARCs review records and issue directives at mid-semester, they may review cadets for retention/disenrollment only at end-of-semester/summer progress reports.    During the review, ARCs consider all pertinent information.  A profile or character sketch of the cadet is composed using information from the instructor comment cards, formal records of counseling, military performance appraisals, athletic ratings, and medical history.  Cadets, advisors, and Squadron Commanders do not attend records reviews.  ARC coordinators send notification letters, listing ARC actions and recommendations, to Squadron Commanders, with copies to advisors. Squadron Commanders are responsible for delivering the letters to cadets.  Cadets recommended for disenrollment after a records review receive a letter via COMPASS through their Squadron Commander notifying them of a mandatory formation to receive information about the ARC appeal process.  At this meeting, the ARC coordinators distribute official disenrollment recommendation notification letters and brief cadets on the appeal process.  After receiving this documentation, cadets have 72 hours to choose one of the following two options:    Personal Interview. Cadets directly address the ARC.  Appealing cadets may submit  written statements for consideration at the personal interview.  Written appeal packages are due to the ARC coordinator no later than five days after receipt of the official notification letter.  The ARC interview is the only time cadets are permitted to present their cases verbally and/or in writing.  To exercise this right, a cadet must appear in person on the date, time, and location the cadet is scheduled.  Cadets will not be allowed to call witnesses to testify in person before the ARC, although the advisor and Squadron Commander are required to attend.  When preparing for an ARC interview, a cadet should do the following:  Give mature consideration to the situation.  Be prepared to be open and frank with the committee and, while not making excuses, discuss personal matters, if any, which affected academics.  Before the committee interview, meet with the academic advisor to complete the Academy Form 68 and to design an academic program that provides the best opportunity for academic success.  Come to the ARC interview with a plan and be prepared to take responsibility for the current situation.  The plan should be a realistic assessment of ability and potential to set attainable goals and discontinue habits that netted the current poor results.  Consult with current course instructors to establish a "get well" plan of action IAW the Academy Form 68, Cadet Academic Deficiency Evaluation and Probation Action Plan.  Waiver of personal interview and written statements.  The ARC interviews cadets who elect option (1) above no earlier than the day after appeal packages are due. After the interview, the ARC re-votes to retain or recommend disenrollment  of the appealing cadet.  Cadets appealing a disenrollment recommendation in the spring semester will not be enrolled in a summer academics course.      DFVR sends notification letters containing ARC actions, via Squadron Commanders and academic advisors, to cadets retained after the ARC interviews.  The ARC forwards disenrollment recommendations to the Dean of the Faculty.  The Dean of the Faculty can retain the cadet or forward the ARC’s disenroll recommendation to the Superintendent for final disposition.  If the Superintendent’s decision is to disenroll the cadet, the Staff Judge Advocate (JA) sends notification letters to cadets. 2-5.8.  DISENROLLMENT PROCEDURES Disenrollment of Cadets.  Deficient cadets are processed for discharge or disenrollment in accordance with the provisions of the Academy Instruction 36-3504, Disenrollment of United States Air Force Academy Cadets.  Notification Procedures.  JA notifies cadets of final disenrollment decisions.  Disenrolled first- and second-class cadets will also be notified about decisions concerning their active duty commitments.  JA counsels all dis-enrollees of their rights and options.  Legal Reexamination.  Title 10, U.S.C. 9351.  Any disenrolled cadet who is deficient because of failure to pass a required examination or course equivalent in any one subject is entitled to a reexamination of equal scope and difficulty in that subject, provided both the cadet’s semester and cumulative GPAs are greater than or equal to 2.0 for all courses exclusive of the one failed.  The cadet must apply in writing to the Curriculum and Academic Affairs Division (DFVRC).  Notification.  DFVR notifies eligible cadets in writing.  The notification letters include all pertinent information regarding the entitlement to reexamination.   Cadet Acknowledgment.  Cadets entitled to a reexamination must be counseled by the ARC coordinator concerning their Title 10 rights.  Cadets will designate in writing their intent to take the reexamination.  The written notification is due no later than ten days after receipt of the official written notification of disenrollment. Cadets electing reexamination  will not out-process but will be removed from the Cadet Wing until the results of the reexaminations are known. The department offering the failed course prepares, administers, and grades the reexamination within five duty days of their notification of the request.  The five duty days do not include weekend days, federal holidays, periods of authorized emergency leave, or days the cadet is admitted as an inpatient in a hospital.  Cadets awaiting reexamination will not be sent TDY.  The re-exam will be of comparable scope and difficulty to the final examination in the failed course.  Departments notify DFVRC in writing of the cadet's grade for placement in the cadet's official records.  The department administering the reexamination endorses the cadet acknowledgment letter, annotating the date, time, and location of the reexamination.    Cadets prepare for reexamination primarily through individual study.  They will not be allowed to attend regularly scheduled classes in the course in which they are retesting.  When cadets are disenrolled at the end of the fall semester or at the end of the summer term, they will attend all academic and military formations while awaiting reexamination.  When cadets are disenrolled at the end of spring semester, they retest in lieu of summer break.  A cadet who successfully passes a reexamination is formally readmitted to the Cadet Wing.  The failed course must be repeated the following offering term. (See the Academy Instruction 36-3523.)  A cadet who fails a reexamination is not authorized a second reexamination.  The case will be forwarded for final disposition in accordance with USAFAI 36-3504.  Readmission of Former Cadets Program (The Academy Instruction 36-2005).  Cadets disenrolled academically must attend another four-year accredited university to qualify for readmission.  If they improve their grades and take courses that may transfer to the Academy, they may be eligible to apply for readmission under the Readmission of Former Cadets Program.  The program requires interested students to again secure an Academy appointment and again complete the entire application process.  2-5.9.  CLASS ATTENDANCE BY CADETS RECOMMENDED FOR DISENROLLMENT Class Attendance by Cadets Recommended for Disenrollment.  Cadets recommended for disenrollment after the fall or summer semester will be placed into classes in a provisional status.  Cadets recommended for disenrollment after the spring semester will be removed from first period summer academics, military training, and summer break and be placed in Operations Group Admin Squadron.  Cadets will remain in this status until their cases have been resolved.  A disenrolled cadet is immediately withdrawn from classes and begins out-processing.  A retained cadet is removed from provisional status and readmitted to the Cadet Wing.  Resigning Cadets. Cadets who plan to resign at the end of a semester and elect to take  final examinations will receive letter grades and may be disenrolled for academic deficiency in lieu of voluntary resignation if they are deficient in studies at the final grade report.  To avoid the possibility of academic disenrollment, a cadet must resign and be officially removed from all classes prior to the start of finals.  The Director of Cadet Personnel and Administration (A1A) and DFVRC will agree upon and publish the latest date a cadet may resign and still be excused from final examinations.  Cadets resigning after Lesson T20, but before final examinations, will receive grades of WP or WF, as appropriate.  2-5.10.  WHY SHOULD CADETS WORRY ABOUT ACADEMIC DISENROLLMENT? First- and second-class cadets disenrolled from the Academy have an active duty service obligation.  It is rare for this obligation to be waived.  Academic disenrollment seriously affects a student's chances of enrolling in another university, even on a probationary status.  Many universities require a petition for entry and allow only one semester to correct deficiencies.  Academically disenrolled cadets desiring readmission into the Academy must go through the same admission procedure as new appointees and again secure an appointment.  Readmission is not assured.  2-5.11.  WHAT CAN A CADET DO TO PREVENT ACADEMIC PROBLEMS? Take responsibility for her/his academic program.  Create a long-term plan for academic success by setting realistic, attainable goals.  Take advantage of all the help that is available, including EI, the Academic Success Center  (the Writing Center and the Academic Success Center programs), and the Cadet Counseling and Leadership Development Center.  Consult their squadron academic officer, advisor, AIC, course instructors, and DFVRC Academic Review Committee Coordinators.  Approach their scholarship to the Academy with an understanding that academic, athletic, and military performance are of equal importance to one's success at the Academy.  Strive for  	EXCELLENCE in academics. It is a core value that applies to all mission areas.  SECTION 2-6 SPECIAL PROGRAMS   2-6.1 GENERAL GUIDANCE FOR CADET SEMESTER EXCHANGE ABROAD PROGRAM (CSEAP), CADET SEMESTER STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM (CSSAP), AND SERVICE ACADEMY EXCHANGE PROGRAM (SAEP) If you are leaving the Academy later than Lesson 10 or returning prior to Lesson 30 you MUST take required Phy Ed, Leadership, and CE classes. This will alleviate down time and congestion of the following spring schedule. For any remote coursework taken while on exchange, submit the Remote Coursework Form to USAFA/DFVR (dfvr.mail@afacademy.af.edu) prior to departing the Academy but NLT Lesson T3. If you have not turned in a completed form (with all required signatures) you will not be enrolled in any remote courses. Academy cadets enrolled in remote courses while on exchange or study abroad are assigned to section 815 for P/F grades; Academy cadets enrolled in remote courses while on exchange or study abroad are assigned to section 915 for A-F grades. No validation credit will be awarded unless provided to DFVR from the appropriate academic department using the Validation and Transfer Credit form on the DFVR SharePoint site.  Academy cadets preparing for and/or on exchange will coordinate with their academic advisors, departments, and DFVR/DFIP IAW in the timeline below to ensure courses taken at the respective institution will satisfy academic requirements and appropriate credit is received for courses taken.  Table 19.

CADET SEMESTER EXCHANGE ABROAD PROGRAM (CSEAP)  The Academy offers semester-long, reciprocal exchange programs with several international military academies.  Exchange agreements are approved by the Academy Superintendent and Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs (SAF/IA), and their equivalent foreign counterparts.  Current exchanges exist with Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, and Spain.  These exchanges occur during the fall and/or spring semester of the first- or secondclass year. International semester exchange cadets at the Academy are not required to take final  exams.  This program is grounded in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 16-109 (International Affairs Specialist Program) requirements, established by AFI 16-111 (The Academy Cadet Semester Exchange Abroad Program), and administered at the Academy in accordance with USAFA Instruction 16-101 (International Education Programs).  In accordance with USAFA Instruction 16-101, the International Programs Council oversees all Academy international programs, and DFLC/DFLCP administers them.  The strategic purpose of the program is to strengthen the Academy cadets’ foreign language skills and bolster cross-cultural understanding and interoperability between US and allied air forces to meet DoD and DAF objectives.  2-6.3.  CADET SEMESTER STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM (CSSAP)  The Academy has semester-long study abroad programs at foreign civilian universities for cadets studying several of the eight languages taught by DFLC: Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.  This program was established in accordance with the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s 2005 Defense Language Transformation Roadmap to “exploit study abroad opportunities to facilitate language acquisition” (required actions 1.Q.). Its purpose is to strengthen the Academy cadets’ foreign language skills, increase cultural awareness and enhance their ability to operate effectively in cross-cultural environments.  CSSAP is administered at the Academy in accordance with USAFA Instruction 16-101.  Though this program was originally designed for Foreign Area Studies majors, cadets from other disciplines are encouraged to participate, provided that their advisors, working in concert with other departments and DFLC/DFLCP prior to departure, can establish a plan for meeting all graduation requirements.  2-6.4.  CSEAP/CSSAP SELECTION, PREPARATION, AND ACADEMICS  Candidate Selection.  Cadets interested in semester exchange or study abroad are encouraged to work with academic advisors as early as their Fourth-class year at the Academy.  Cadets should plan their coursework to accommodate a semester to study at a foreign institution.  Second- and third-class cadets with a minimum 2.6 cumulative GPA, who will have completed the appropriate For Lang 322, or equivalent, by the time of departure are eligible to apply.  Cumulative MPA and PEA scores of 2.6 or better are also expected.  Waivers to these criteria may be granted by CWV or ADP.  Program participants may not be on any probationary status at the time of travel.  A cadet who is on probation at the time when applications are submitted may only apply with Squadron Commander approval.  Eligible cadets should apply through the Office of International Programs (DFLCP) in the fall of the second-class year or earlier as denoted by a specific exchange program.  DFLCP will ensure notification to the Cadet Wing of the application period.  Preparation.  Cadets selected as primary or alternate candidates for semester overseas programs must be available all three summer periods prior to their study abroad semester and could be required to take an academic course or depart on exchange without leave. Cadets  must complete academic coursework as necessary to satisfy all graduation requirements.  Cadets must coordinate with their academic advisors and ADP to develop a plan specifying which classes they expect to receive credit for while studying abroad.  DFLCP will provide course catalogs or equivalent for each program.  However, due to the structure and curricula of our partner academies, course information is not readily available for all locations.  The cadet will need to work closely with the academic advisor, DFLCP, and any departments involved in the cadet’s credit transfer plan to ensure all major, elective, and core requirements will be satisfied before graduation.    Transfer Credit.  Course credit transfer may be awarded to meet major’s requirements, Foreign Area Studies electives (for non-FAS majors), and core equivalents. Academy cadets will receive pass/fail grades for their foreign coursework.  Cadets considering participation in CSEAP or CSSAP should work with their advisor, ADP, and DFLCP to carefully plan and manage their academic program before, during and after their intended semester of participation.  Within the spirit of the program’s purpose, this planning should maximize opportunities for foreign coursework to transfer toward their academic major’s requirements and FAS courses.  The following process should be used by all cadets and advisors planning to participate in CSEAP/CSSAP:  As soon as possible, but no later than Lesson 15 of the semester prior to CSEAP/CSSAP participation, the cadet and advisor shall establish an academic plan that maximizes the opportunities for foreign coursework to transfer toward their academic major’s requirements and electives. Each academic major is encouraged to be as flexible as  possible in determining how each of these courses may fit into their academic major’s requirements and therefore maximize the cadet’s ability to receive transfer credit for their time abroad. In addition to major’s classes, any cadet participating in a semester program  overseas in a foreign language environment may receive experiential credit for For Lang 402 and For Ar Stu 495. A cadet may typically earn credit for a maximum of 6 courses while abroad and may request authorization from the DFLCP Director to receive credit for additional courses.  The Director will coordinate with the AIC of the cadets’ departments in cases for which an exceptional course load pursued overseas justifies additional credit.    Credit toward academic courses that meet graduation requirements will be the primary objective within the maximum course load, including course equivalents for major’s, elective, and core courses.  Approval for credit to fulfill requirements for Academy core courses is possible using core substitutes (Table 20) and constrained by considerations (a) through (g) below:  	 Table 20. Exchange/Abroad Program Transfer Credits Cadet can receive transfer credit for the following core substitute Fulfilling the requirement for one of the following core courses If the course taken abroad/on exchange contains roughly the following course objectives/content  Bas Sci 401  - Biology 215 (Bas Sci 401BI)  - any course using the content of biology to teach critical thinking and the principles of science and the scientific method - Math 300/356/377 (Bas Sci 401MA) - introductory statistics, probability, hypothesis testing, probability distributions, correlation or regression  Engr 401  - Astr Engr 310   (Engr 401AS)  - history, principles, challenges of space, orbits, spacecraft systems, launch vehicles, re-entry or mission management - Aero Engr 315   (Engr 401AE) - introductory aircraft design, fluid mechanics, airfoil/wing aerodynamics, aircraft performance, or stability & control - ECE 315   (Engr 401EC) - introductory electrical or computer engineering principles, signal analysis, electronic system design or evaluation  Soc Sci 401  - Mgt 400   (Soc Sci 401MG)  - successful techniques in allowing people to understand & influence their environment, models & processes, interrelationships of power, or techniques contributing to decision making in complex, uncertain situations  Hum 401  - English 411   (Hum 401EN)  - moral & intellectual aspects of war as expressed in literature, written and oral communications skills, or major canonical works of fiction, memoir and oratory addressing complexities & ethical issues of war/leadership - Philos 210   (Hum 401PH) - study of major moral theories, application to moral problems, ethical action, understanding of civic, cultural & international contexts or influential normative theories of ethics, devotes substantial in-class treatment to the justwar tradition with associated reading assignments and homework  Equivalency is defined as a suitable substitute for the corresponding Academy offering within the spirit of the program’s overarching purpose; course syllabus and associated learning outcomes need not correspond on a direct one-for-one basis in order to receive credit for a course.  If a department believes the substance of a particular core equivalent is not met by the CSEAP/CSSAP course offering, departments and advisors are encouraged to work with cadets to develop acceptable alternatives aligned with the desired outcome.  For instance, a department may work with the cadet and an instructor to create a 499 course with independent coursework, and/or deliverable materials that may be completed during the CSSAP semester and either submitted or presented upon the cadet’s return (or via networked means while abroad).  Additional requirements should be the exception, not the rule.    Cadets and their advisors are responsible for working with departments to coordinate approval for credit within the major or minor discipline.  DFLC/DFLCP, working with DFVR, will coordinate with departments to effect transfer credit for core courses.  Approval for equivalency credit is granted by the Department Head or the department’s designated official.  Within one week of beginning academic coursework at the foreign military academy or civilian institution, each cadet must contact DFLCP to update and/or refine their academic plan for the semester.  Offered courses frequently change.  DFLCP will work with the advisor and the cadet to adjust the plan based on circumstances.  Potential transfer credit from any additional departments will be coordinated within two weeks of notification.   DFLCP will maintain records of foreign coursework to include country, location, institution, course titles, and descriptions.  Upon receiving proper coordination/approval for transfer credit for Academy courses and successfully completing equivalent foreign coursework, major’s courses, FAS courses, core course, or core substitute will appear on the cadet’s transcript indicating pass/fail credit.  Due to curriculum changes and internal scheduling processes at foreign institutions, course availability cannot be guaranteed until after cadets report to their respective overseas programs.  Cadets and advisors will refer to DFLCP resources during planning to confirm expected course offerings.  In cases of unresolved conflict between departments and advisors regarding equivalent credit, the circumstances will be presented to the DFLCP Director who will, if necessary, present it to the appropriate Division Chair for a final decision on divisional core substitute credit.     2-6.5.  SERVICE ACADEMY EXCHANGE PROGRAM   (USAFA Instruction 36-2001, Cadet Service Academy Exchange Program).  The Academy has a semester-long exchange program with the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy at New London.  Cadets selected for this program during their fourth semester attend the sister academy during the fall of their secondclass year. Academic grades received at sister service academies transfer to the Academy and are  included in the cumulative GPA.  If end-of-semester grades would result in academic probation status at the Academy, the cadet is placed on academic probation upon return.  Interested cadets apply through their Squadron Commander.  Students and advisors should work with AICs and departments to ensure maximum flexibility for students participating in this program; courses taken at sister service academies should generally meet the intent of similar classes offered at the Academy, recognizing these courses will not provide an exact one-to-one match of course objectives and topics.  2-6.6.  ACADEMIC SUCCESS CENTER (ASC)   The Academic Success Center is a centralized learning center designed to enhance cadet performance and is comprised of three key educational units: Quantitative Reasoning Center, Communication Strategies Center, and Strategies for Academic Success.  The Quantitative Reasoning Center offers instructional support in Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and Mechanical Engineering.  The Communication Strategies Center offers Reading Enhancement classes, a Writing Center to help with papers and reports for all classes, and a Public Speaking Lab to assist cadets with their speaking presentations.  The Strategies for Academic Success program offers classes and individualized assistance to assist cadets with learning strategies for general as well as subject specific content, as well as extra instruction and support for ESL and international cadets.  The vision of the Academic Success Center is to support and encourage academic excellence in all cadets through faculty-led, personalized instruction that advances study strategies, critical thinking, STEM, and communication literacy.  The ASC works to inspire cadets to pursue graduate education and become life-long learners.  Quantitative Reasoning Center (QRC).  The QRC provides evening extra instruction (EI) for STEM subjects.  Supplemental instruction in select core quantitative disciplines is provided in individual, small group, and workshop settings.  Subjects include Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and Mechanical Engineering.  The QRC is open in the evenings, Monday through Thursday, from 1730 – 2130. Appointments are recommended and some drop-in hours may be available.  Students should first seek EI from their primary course instructors, but the QRC is an excellent source of supplemental instruction. To learn more  about the Center’s services visit our Blackboard site at https://aetc.blackboard.com (log in and click the Academic Services tab at the top). To schedule extra instruction visit https://usafa.mywconline.com/.   Communication Strategies Center.  The Communication Strategies Center offers classes and individualized support for reading, writing, and speaking enhancement to best prepare all cadets to be well-informed critical readers, writers, and speakers. For information, please contact the Director of the Communication Strategies Center, Dr. Elisa CogbillSeiders.   Introduction to Communication.  Comm Strt 101 and 101X.  This 20-Lesson course is designed to enhance a cadet’s ability to skillfully and ethically respond to academic, professional, and intercultural communicative situations.  The course introduces students to evidence-based communicative practices through a variety of critical reading tasks, with an emphasis on use of core academic texts.  Please contact Dr. Gary Mills or your academic advisor to discuss enrolling in this class.  Cadets can enroll in Comm Strt 101 (first 20 Lessons of the semester) or Comm Strt 101X (second 20 Lessons of the semester).  Writing Center.  The Writing Center is open in the evenings, Monday through Thursday, from 1730 – 2115 for appointments or walk-ins.  Individual appointments can also be scheduled during the day through MyWCOnline (https://usafa.mywconline.com/). For more information, please contact Dr. Chris Gras.   Public Speaking Lab.   The Public Speaking Lab is the Academy’s academic support center for any and all oral communication needs. Public speaking specialists help cadets refine and improve academic presentations in the classroom, leadership speeches in the cadet wing, and interview preparation for cadet jobs and graduate school programs. Individual appointments can be scheduled during the day and evening. For more information, please contact Dr. Daniel Johnson   Strategies for Academic Success. The Strategies for Academic Success program offers full  semester (Lrn Strt 101) and half semester (Lrn Strt 102) courses which focus on the most effective learning strategies for academic achievement, time-task management, prioritization, note-taking, and reading skills.  Discussions about mindset and grit are also included in the classes.  Cadets should contact Mr. Spencer Thomas or stop by the Academic Success Center to discuss an individualized program or enrollment in a Lrn Strt course.  Select fourth-class cadets will be enrolled in fall or spring Learning Strategies courses based on entering academic composite numbers or performance during a grading cycle.   ESL/International Cadet Support.  For English as a Second Language (ESL) and international cadet assistance, please contact Prof. Connie Leonard   2-6.7.  ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE (ESL) PROGRAM.  Every summer during the in processing of basic cadets, DFVR will administer questions to international cadets regarding their English language proficiency. DFVR will use the responses to these questions to determine if an international cadet should be coded as an ESL student and placed in English for Academic Purposes (EAP 109), Academic Communication for English as a Second Language Four-year Exchange Cadets (EAP 209), Academic Communication for English as a Second Language Semester-Exchange Cadets. If further information is required, the DFVR ESL Coordinator will conduct an interview with the cadets to determine ESL status and English course placement.  If enrolled in the ESL program, the ESL Coordinator will notify the Registrar Customer  Service and Scheduling Division (DFVRR) to update the cadet’s record with ESL status NLT Lesson 2 of the Fall semester. Questions regarding the ESL designation of a cadet should be directed to DFVR.  All cadets coded as ESL are authorized extra time to complete quizzes, graded review (GRs) and final examinations. Instructors are responsible for recognizing ESL cadets in their classes and in coordination with their department leadership are responsible for promulgating the guidance provided.   Academic departments may grant up to double time on quizzes, graded reviews, and final examinations to ESL students as agreed upon by course director, instructor, and student. Academic departments may allow extra time on exams that require essay questions or that contain verbal reasoning problems but may deny requests for extra time on exams that are purely quantitative in nature. ESL students must be permitted to use an English or foreign  language dictionary, but must coordinate with the instructor the specifics of what dictionary will be used and how and when it will be used. This guidance does not apply to DFLC foreign language classes. Suitable arrangements must be made between cadets and instructors to schedule quizzes, graded reviews, and final exams.    Foreign language requirements are waived for international cadets. DFLC determines foreign language validation credit for U.S. ESL cadets. DFLC is responsible for submitting a list of cadets earning foreign language validation credit to DFVR.   2-6.8.  ACADEMICALLY AT-RISK PROGRAM This program is designed to provide academically "at-risk" cadets with a lighter academic load during their fourth-class year to increase their chances for successfully meeting graduation requirements.  Cadets may not decline their placement into the program, nor can they volunteer for the program. Cadets may volunteer for the Learning Strategies 101 course.   "At-risk" fourth-class cadets take four academic courses and Learning Strategies 101 during the fall semester.  During the spring semester, at-risk cadets will take five academic courses.  Cadets may be placed in the program based on ACT or SAT scores, Prior Academic Record (PAR), Academic Composite, or other criteria as established by the Academy.  Procedures  Academically at-risk cadets are identified on the APS by enrollment in Lrn Strt 101 in the fourth-class fall (refer to Appendix 2, Course Descriptions, under Learning Strategies).  An academically at-risk cadet who wishes to take more than five academic courses in the fourth-class spring semester may do so if the cadet qualifies for an overload (3.0 or greater fall GPA).  At mid-semester, the ARC may direct any overloaded, deficient, cadet to drop a course.  An academically at-risk cadet who fails a course during the academic year may be directed to forfeit summer break and take an academic course in its place.  2-6.9.  EXTRA INSTRUCTION (EI) (USAFA Instruction 36-3509, Extra Instruction for Cadets).  Extra instruction provides an opportunity for students to meet one-on-one with their instructors to obtain additional, out-of-class assistance in academic areas. Extra instruction is the right of all cadets and is highly encouraged for cadets experiencing academic difficulty.  All instructors are willing to help any cadet in need of additional academic assistance.  2-6.10.  HOSPITAL INSTRUCTION (HI) (USAFA Instruction 36-3509, Extra Instruction for Cadets).  Hospital instruction helps cadets maintain their academic course work at a proficient level while hospitalized.  While this program is primarily for cadets who experience an extended stay due to illness or injury, extra instruction services are available for all cadets.  2-6.11.  RETURN-TO-LEARN CONCUSSION PROTOCOL Return-to-Learn is a post-concussion academic recovery program.  The goal is to provide a cadet with academic accommodations during the cadet’s concussion recovery in order to give their brain the best chance to heal. After a concussion, the brain experiences a temporary energy crisis that  may make it difficult to engage in cognitive activities.  Return-to-learn exists to allow the brain to heal during this energy crisis by preventing a premature return to full academics.  Table 21. Return-to-Learn Stages 	Stages 	Accommodations 1 – Cognitive Rest 	• Cadet does not attend class  • No homework 2 – Trial of Cognitive Activity 	• 20-30 min. of homework followed by 15 min. of rest • • Increase homework by 15 min. increments Move to Stage 3 when you can study for 60 min. and remain symptom free 3 – Return to Class (maximal 	• modifications) • • Attend some classes.  Avoid classes/activities that provoke symptoms Do not take quizzes or GRs Begin to make up missed work (e.g., reading assignments) 4 – Return to Class (minimal 	• modifications) Attend all classes. However, may miss a particular class that provokes symptoms • Begin to make up missed quizzes/GRs 5 –Full Class Attendance 	• Fully participate in academics • Completes make up of any missed work  I should expect a Return-to-Learn cadet to be:  …in Stage 1 (Cognitive Rest) for 24-48 hours. …in Stage 2 (Trial of Cognitive Activity) within a few days from injury. …in Stage 3 (Return to Class (max. modifications)) within the first week from injury. …in Stage 4 (Return to Class (min. modifications)) within 10 days from injury.  …in Stage 5 (Full Class Attendance) at approximately 2 weeks from injury.  I should be concerned if a Return-to-Learn cadet: …is still in Stage 1 (Cognitive Rest) after 5 days from injury.  …hasn’t reached Stage 2 (Trial of Cognitive Activity) after first week from injury. …hasn’t reached Stage 3 (Return to Class (max. modifications)) within 10 days from injury.  …hasn’t reached Stage 4 (Return to Class (min. modifications)) within 2 weeks from injury.  …hasn’t reached Stage 5 (Full Class Attendance) within 3 weeks from injury.  This timeline should be used as a general rule of thumb – understanding that every concussion heals differently. If you notice that your cadet is falling into the concerning timeline,  it would help to meet and/or teleconference with the cadet, academic advisor, instructor, and RTL liaison.   It is important to watch for the following characteristics in a concussed cadet:  Increased problems with attention and/or concentration Difficulty with remembering or learning new information Longer time needed to complete tasks Inappropriate or impulsive behavior Greater irritability and/or emotional liability Decreased ability to cope with stress Difficulty or distress in a stimulating environment Physical symptoms such as: headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue (These are all symptoms of a concussion and an increased intensity or onset of new symptoms may demonstrate a need for slower return-to-learn and additional medical attention.  Presence of these symptoms for longer than three weeks without improvement signals a need for further medical attention.  If you witness a cadet demonstrating these symptoms please verify that they have a clinic follow-up within the week. If you are  concerned, escort them to the Cadet Clinic.)  Protocol Management.    After the diagnosis of a concussion, the cadet’s academic advisor and Squadron Commander will supervise the cadet’s return-to-learn.  These personnel will work with the cadet and their instructors, professors, as well as medical staff in order to develop a customized plan.  As the cadet moves through the return-to-learn stages, the academic advisor and Squadron Commander will provide updates on the cadet’s progress.  Personnel in the Cadet Clinic will assign the return-to-learn stages and will maintain and disseminate an accurate Form-18. It is imperative that Squadron Commanders and academic advisors  provide feedback to medical personnel on their concussed cadet’s academic progress.   Returning to the classroom does not mean the cadet is symptom-free.  The gradual return to full academics (i.e. caught up with syllabi in all classes) should be modified individually for each cadet based on symptoms and course content.  Return-to-learn is completed in several stages and symptoms are monitored at each stage.  Certain activities may trigger new symptoms or worsen existing ones.  In this case, the cadet may need to be re-evaluated by medical personnel. Cadets with a concussion are seen at least once per  week in the Concussion Clinic.  Concussion and mild traumatic brain injury are covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).  Any action taken in this process must remain compliant with the ADAAA law.  Return-to-Learn Stages.  The role of the Squadron Commander and academic advisor is to oversee their concussed cadet’s academic recovery.  Medical staff will assign the return-to-learn stages. In a minority of cases the Squadron Commander and academic advisor may need to communicate directly with the treating physician to ensure an effective Return-to-Learn protocol is in place.  The duration of each stage should be specific to each individual cadet and is based on the symptoms experienced by the cadet. Regardless of stage, the Squadron Commander and academic advisor will jointly manage return-to-learn. During stages 1 and 2, the cadet will be on bed rest so these stages will be primarily managed by the Squadron Commander.  When the cadet is ready to return to class (i.e., progresses to stage 3) the Squadron Commander will hand over primary management responsibilities to the cadet’s academic advisor.   Stage 1 - Cognitive Rest (typically same day of injury)  Avoid: classroom attendance, formation, briefings, homework, “screen time” (i.e.  phone, computer, or video game use), reading, and loud noise and bright lights (e.g., meals should be provided in their dorm in order to avoid Mitchell Hall). (In light of the energy crisis that occurs after a concussion, cognitive rest allows the brain to heal more quickly.  If the cadet is still experiencing symptoms without stressors or activity, they should remain at the cognitive rest stage. When the cadet has no or  minimal symptoms at rest, they will progress to the next stage.)   Stage 2 - Trial of Cognitive Activity (return to homework)  Attempt cognitive activity such as homework or reading for 20-30 minutes, gradually increase time increments, allow for approximately 15 minutes of rest in between each activity, and if the cadet develops symptoms after participating in activities, they should rest until symptoms subside. (Once the cadet can complete approximately an hour of cognitive activity without the onset of concussion symptoms, they will progress to the next stage.)  Stage 3 - Return to Class (with maximum modifications) Return to a partial day of classes.  Avoid specific classes or activities that lead to the onset of symptoms (e.g., particularly challenging classes, labs, and intensive computer use).  The cadet should not participate in physical education classes.  The cadet should communicate to their academic advisor, professors, and instructors when they are experiencing symptoms and ask to leave class or modify classes in order to minimize the worsening of concussion symptoms.  The cadet should not take quizzes or GRs, as a quiz or GR taken early in concussion recovery will not accurately represent their ability and knowledge.  The cadet can begin to make up work (e.g., reading assignments) missed when they were not in class.  The cadet can begin to attend morning accountability formation, briefings, and meals in Mitchell Hall unless they provoke concussion symptoms. (Once the cadet can complete a partial day of classes without the onset of concussion symptoms, they will progress to the next stage.)  Stage 4 - Return to Class (with minimum modifications) The cadet returns to a full day of classes but should take breaks when necessary.  The cadet can begin to take quizzes and GRs, although they should be provided an opportunity to take an adapted form in order to prevent triggering symptoms (oral exam instead of written, paper instead of computer, longer time limit on a timed exam, etc.).  Single class exceptions for a particular class that provokes symptoms may be necessary. (Once a cadet can attend all classes without the onset of concussion symptoms, they will progress to the next stage.)  Stage 5 - Full Class Attendance (no modifications)  The cadet returns to classes as usual, fully participating and taking all quizzes and GRs in the original format.  The cadet will continue to work with professors and instructors in order to ensure that any missed work is made up and they are caught up to the syllabus.  The expectation is that the cadet attends all formations and briefings. (Continue to monitor for concussion symptoms, even after the cadet has reached stage 5.  Any return of symptoms should be referred to a medical provider at the Cadet Concussion Clinic.)  Symptoms Persisting Longer Than Three Weeks.  For most cadets, concussion symptoms will resolve, and they will return to class with no modifications within three weeks. For those cadets who continue to experience symptoms past the three-week period, there are differing ways to make academic adjustments and accommodations. The cadet may need a change in schedule (e.g. drop a class); or special arrangements may be required to allow for extended absences, quizzes and GRs, term papers, and projects.   Potential Accommodations for Professors/Instructors to Consider:  General Academic Accommodations:  modify or cancel an assignment(s), short inclass breaks, extended time on assignments or quizzes/GRs, quieter/dimmer exam room, ability to record lectures or provide note takers, alternative forms of quizzes and GRs (e.g., oral instead of written, paper instead of computer), excused absences, schedule change, and dropping a class that induces concussion symptoms.  Symptom-Based Accommodations Table 22.

MARTINSON HONORS PROGRAM  The Martinson Honors Program, the honors program at the Academy, helps academically talented and intellectually curious cadets at the Academy reach their full scholastic potential. As a holistic program that blends an innovative, engaging, and integrative path through the core curriculum with unique extracurricular experiences, the Honors Program serves as an exemplar of academic integrity and excellence.  Upon graduation, Scholars are prepared for challenging, twenty-first century command positions and possess the intellectual curiosity and commitment to lifelong learning that will foster their growth as future officers, thinkers, and leaders.  The curriculum consists primarily of smaller-sized, discussion-based core course sections that deepen and broaden Scholars’ intellectual development, as a complement to existing academic, leadership, military training, and athletics programs.  Background.  The Martinson Honors Program addresses several academic issues at the Academy, several trends in the Air and Space Forces, the global security environment, and higher education in the 21st  century. The Academy’s efforts to recruit the best qualified applicants, in addition to the competitiveness of our cadets for graduate scholarships, support a program focused on intellectual development across all four of the Academy’s academic divisions.   Admission to the Martinson Honors Program.  Shortly after the first progress report in the fall semester, eligible cadets in each new class (based on their fall prog GPA and faculty recommendations) will be offered the opportunity to apply for program entry.  Cadets who wish to take Martinson Scholars courses, but who are not formally in the program, may do so on a space available basis with the approval of the Department Head in charge of the course and the Martinson Honors Program Director.  A cadet will be considered for removal from the program if their GPA drops below 3.5. Additionally, any form of probation (honor, conduct,  aptitude, athletic, or academic) may restrict a Scholar to course participation and from complementary opportunities.  Note:  Cadets should not be enrolled into a Scholars course designated with an (S) suffix unless one or more of the following criteria are met: 1) the cadet is enrolled in the Martinson Honors Program or; 2) the cadet has a cumulative 3.5 GPA or above and the recommendation of the Department Head managing the course or; 3) if the cadet has below a cumulative 3.5 GPA they must have the recommendation from the Department Head managing the course and concurrence from the Martinson Honors Program Director for non-scholar participation in a scholars course.  Martinson Honors Program Curriculum.   To graduate as an Academy Scholar, cadets must: 1) be formally accepted into the program; 2) complete the required capstone, Inter Dis 463S; 3) complete at least nine additional Scholars courses, one of which may be a capstone in the major or a 499; 4) graduate with a GPA of 3.5 or higher. Please note that courses not listed here may occasionally be offered, and courses listed here may not be offered; contact the Program Director for more information.   	  Recommended Sequence for Martinson Honors Program Courses:  Table 23.

DF SUMMER PROGRAMS   Academic, airmanship/aviation, and military training core requirements are offered during the summer.  The Commandant of Cadets summer scheduler coordinates scheduling procedures with DF, 306 FTG, AD, and SpDet.  As the single point of contact for all summer program actions, the Academy/CWTS also notifies cadets of all airmanship, athletic, DF-coordinated and military training summer program registration and changes.  The following DF programs are authorized by the Academy and considered non-cadre related.  These programs can fulfill the second training program required each summer for upper-class cadets:  Internships  Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) Program  Cultural Immersion Program (CIP)  Cadet Summer Research Program (CSRP)  Cadet Summer Language Immersion Program (CSLIP)  Summer Academics plus Summer Break Slots (limited)  Cadet Semester Study Abroad Program (CSSAP) Cadet Semester Exchange Abroad Program (CSEAP)  All cadets are normally assigned three weeks of summer break every summer.  They may voluntarily choose to forego their summer break to accommodate additional time for CSRP and/or other non-cadre related programs or an academic class.  In order for cadets to participate in two non-cadre related programs during the same summer, those cadets must forego their summer break.  Summer Academics.  The purpose of summer academics is to enable cadets to correct a failed grade or deficiency and allow students to achieve personal goals such as completing a major, strengthening weak areas, or preparing for special academic programs. Each fall, the DFVRC  Summer Academics Program Coordinator develops the next summer’s academic schedule.  The goal of this program is to include as many core courses as possible.  Most courses will be open to all interested cadets. Registration for summer academics is during the registration period held in  the spring.  After the established deadline date, changes to a cadet’s summer academic schedule will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Academic Review Committee (ARC) – Directed Summer Academics.  ARCs are Chaired by a Permanent Professor or Department Head (Colonel) from DF for each class and is the only approval authority which can direct summer academics and/or summer academics in lieu of summer break if deemed necessary for the cadet to maintain an achievable course load and graduate in 4 years.  Summer Academics plus Summer Break.  This program is designed to serve academically “at risk” rising third-class cadets in the learning strategies cohort or cadets directed by the ARC.  Summer Academics in Lieu of Summer Break.  A number of cadets choose to register for summer academics in lieu of summer break to ease future course loads or enrich their academic programs.  Cadets who wish to drop or add a summer academic course must do so prior to the end of the registration period in the spring.  After that date, the only additions or deletions will be ARC actions, CWT changes, or exceptions approved by DFVR.  Cadet Summer Research Program (CSRP). CSRP provides opportunities for cadets to solve relevant problems, learn through real-world application of classroom principles, and build lasting collaborative relationships while participating in research at various military, government, and civilian facilities throughout the world.  CSRP participants receive credit for a military summer training program, and this is considered a career broadening assignment.  Cadets typically have the opportunity to participate in CSRP during the summer following their second-class year; however, in some cases cadets may participate on an unofficial basis in the summer following their third- or fourth-class years.  Cadets interested in competing for a CSRP slot will coordinate directly with their department’s CSRP representative.   2-6.14.  GRADUATE SCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES  Cadets may wish to attend graduate school or pursue careers in the biomedical, legal, or other professions after graduating from the Academy.  Cadets may compete for the following programs:  National Competitive Scholarship Program.  Cadets may compete with students from other universities for scholarships and fellowships to study for advanced degrees in the United States and overseas.  Among the major scholarships available to cadets are the following:  Rhodes Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, Gates Scholarship, Fulbright Scholarship, Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellowship, National Science Foundation Fellowship, John Stark Draper Fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Rice University, Harvard University Scholarship at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, East-West Center Fellowship at the University of Hawaii, Program Research and Education in Space Technology (PREST) Fellowship at George Washington University, University of Washington Engineering Fellowship, the University of Maryland Scholarship and the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica, CA.  Scholarship/Fellowship recipients will incur an active duty service commitment (ADSC).  For additional scholarship opportunities, contact the Graduate Studies Programs Office.  Graduate School Program (GSP).  This program allows selected graduates of the Academy to attend a master's degree program immediately following graduation.  GSP participants will incur an ADSC.  Number of slots available is determined by the Air Force Educational Resources Board (AFERB).  The GSP slots will be used for departments to bring graduates back to teach.  A number of slots are reserved for the Dean of the Faculty.  Candidates for this program must be willing to return to the Academy as academic instructors after gaining Air Force experience. Interested cadets should contact their  Advisor-in-Charge or the GSP departmental representative to receive further details.  Health Professions.  Select cadets may be allowed to enter several health related professions after graduation.    Medicine.  Cadets meeting the Academy's requirements may compete for scholarships to medical, dental, nursing, or physical therapy programs. The Academy can send up to 38 graduates per year to health profession degree and training programs.  For medical training, graduates can attend any CONUS medical school, including the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (Bethesda).  Graduates attending medical schools are funded through the Health Profession Scholarship Program (HPSP).  The HPSP pays for tuition, books and other required expenses, and provides a cost of living stipend.  HPSP recipients incur additional commitments to the Air Force.    Health Profession Opportunities.  Cadets interested in any health profession career field or healthcare-related opportunities should contact the Health Professions Advisor in the Department of Biology (DFBI).  Medical schools do not accept AP or validation credits to fulfill the basic science course requirements.  Cadets planning to attend medical or dental school must take one year each of inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and biology, with a laboratory component.  Legal Training. Academy graduates interested in attending law school may pursue such interest in the following ways:  The Academy Excess Leave Program (U-ELP).   The Secretary of the Air Force may authorize annually that a graduate of the Academy be placed in unfunded excess leave as a student at an American Bar Association (ABA)-approved law school for a period not to exceed 36 months leading to a Juris Doctor and completion of legal licensing requirements necessary for service as an Air Force Judge Advocate.  Eligibility is limited to Academy cadets in their first-class year, in good standing, who have either (a) a minimum 3.25 legal studies major GPA or (b) a minimum 3.5 majors GPA in another academic specialty accompanied by experience in the Cadet Mock Trial Program.  The call for U-ELP applications occurs shortly after the start of the fall semester.  Eligible first-class cadets must submit their application to the DFLA Department Head by 1 December of their first-class year at the Academy.  Selection will be on a best-qualified basis, consistent with the needs of the Air Force.  The selected applicant begins law school in the fall semester after graduation.  Applicants are solely responsible for all application expenses, tuition, fees, associated educational expenses, bar review course fees, and bar examination fees.  Applicants are authorized to accept tuition assistance such as scholarships and endowments.  Funded Legal Education Program / Excess Leave Program (FLEP/ELP). The Air Force   sponsors two programs which allow officers on active duty to earn a law degree:  the Funded Legal Education Program (FLEP) and the Excess Leave Program (ELP).  The number of applicants accepted annually varies according to requirements for Judge Advocates, but in recent years it has been as many as eight and as few as one.  Officers participating in FLEP receive their tuition, fees, and a book allowance from the Air Force while continuing to serve on active duty, thus also receiving full pay, allowances, and other benefits while attending law school.  ELP allows active duty Air Force officers to attend law school using excess leave at the officers’ own expense, and they do not receive pay or allowances while going to school; however, participants continue to accrue time for promotion and retirement purposes and remain eligible for other active duty benefits such as base exchange, commissary, and medical services.  Officers who attend law school under either program practice law in the Air Force as a member of the Judge Advocate General’s Corps upon graduation from law school and admission to any state bar.  Officers are eligible to apply for FLEP between their second and sixth year of active duty and are eligible to apply for ELP between their second and tenth year.  Applications must be submitted online by 10 January of the calendar year in which the applicant intends to enter law school.  Officers who complete these programs are normally designated as Judge Advocates and serve in various legal positions in the Air Force.  For more information about these programs, contact the Law School Advisor (719-333-3680).  2-6.15.  SCHOLARSHIP PREPARATION   Suggested courses for scholarship preparation are listed below.  Cadets who are considering applying for scholarships or fellowships are encouraged to take the GRE during the spring semester of their second-class year.  Cadets desiring additional graduate education information should contact the Graduate Studies Programs Office (719-333-4172).  Suggested Courses for Non-technical Scholarship Preparation:  Core Courses: Schedule before or during fall of first-class year. English 200S Introduction to the Humanities English 411 War Stories Philos 210 Ethics English 400S Literature and the Fine Arts II  Electives (Strongly Recommended): Cadets should schedule for fall of first-class year to retain flexibility, should they decide not to compete for scholarships.

BASIC METEOROLOGY PROGRAM (BMP) The BMP is an opportunity for newly accessed officers from any commissioning source (The Academy, OTS, and AFROTC), to pursue a post-baccalaureate program in meteorology, with follow-on inclusion into the Weather and Environmental Sciences Officer (WESO) career field (15W).  The BMP, managed by the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), is a challenging non-degree program that averages 10-11 months in length.  It consists of:  Minimum of 24 semester hours of junior/senior level (possibly some graduate) courses in meteorology, with three semesters of course work in meteorology being the norm (on the order of 36-42 semester credit hours over summer, fall, spring).  Collateral study in mathematics, physics, and computer science may be required.  BMP does not count against an individual’s total 54-month allotment of AFIT graduate education time.  A 3-year ADSC is incurred, served concurrent with any existing ADSC.  In certain cases, a BS in Meteorology may be attainable, assuming university prerequisites and/or requirements are fulfilled either prior to or as part of the BMP program. BMP candidates must be commissioned prior to program entry and possess a bachelor's degree in a technical field such as math or physics.  Other degrees may be accepted depending on the applicant's math and physics coursework background.  Eligibility requirements are determined by AFIT/CIGW.  The current standards are as follows:  Typically a 2.8 minimum GPA required, both overall and within a student's major discipline.  Minimum prerequisites include one year of calculus-based physics and one year of calculus through integral calculus (generally Calc I, II, III sequence) with minimum grades of "C" in each prerequisite course.   A course in Differential Equations is also strongly recommended prior to program entry or else it will need to be taken as part of the BMP.   Exceptions may be possible on a case-by-case basis, approved by AFIT/CIGW.  Interested cadets should consult with the Academy/DFPM Meteorology AIC to inquire about the BMP, the WESO career field, or to enroll in potentially helpful Academy Meteorology courses (e.g., Advanced Core or Major’s Options) in preparation for BMP.  SECTION 2-7 ACADEMIC PROGRAMS   2-7.1.  PURPOSE OF THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM SECTION Selecting an academic program is one of the most important decisions a cadet makes during  his or her career at the Academy. This handbook is designed to help make the best choice possible.  The program chosen dictates which classes to attend, how many courses to take, future career fields, and graduate school opportunities.  Cadets must be active participants in choosing and designing their academic programs and monitoring their progress.  To determine their preference for an academic major, cadets should consider the kind of work they would like to do and consult their Fourth-Class Advisor, sponsor, , and an academic advisor or the AIC in that discipline.  Cadets who determine their preference early enough can prepare to compete for limited entry specialties.  For more information concerning majors, courses, and career paths, departments have home pages on the Academy public website (https://www.usafa.edu).  2-7.2.  HOW TO USE THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM SECTION Programs are divided by type: disciplinary and interdisciplinary majors and minors (see Section 2-8), and the Bachelor of Science Program (see Section 2-9).  Each program is described in a similar format, providing information about the program, program requirements, and a suggested course sequence.  Fourth-Class Advisors can help cadets find the appropriate person to talk to before registering for courses.   2-7.3.  TYPES OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS The Academy offers a total of 30 academic majors and 22 minors. There are 23 disciplinary  majors, 3 interdisciplinary majors and 4 divisional majors.  The programs and sponsoring division or department are listed in Table 24 below.  Table 24.

Cadets may not earn a disciplinary minor in the same discipline as one’s disciplinary major. You may  earn more than one minor provided: 1) the specified criteria are met for each, and 2) each additional minor contains at least 2 non-core academic courses (6 semester hours) in residence that count exclusively toward the minor (i.e., are not double-counted with the advanced core baskets, major, or another minor).   2-7.4.  ACADEMIC PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Requirements for divisional majors begin at 36 semester hours beyond the core (134 semester hours total).  Requirements for disciplinary and interdisciplinary majors begin at 42 semester hours beyond the core (140 semester hours total).  Academic minors require at least five academic courses totaling no fewer than 15 semester hours.  At least three of those courses must be at the 300-level or 400-level.  Advanced core option courses can potentially “double count” as fulfilling both core requirements and the requirements of an academic minor.  However, no other core courses can count toward a minor.  Disciplinary minors are defined as minors in which at least 12 semester hours are within the same department.  Interdisciplinary minors are defined as minors in which no more than 9 semester hours are from the same department.   To complete a minor, you must complete at least 2 academic courses (6 semester hours) in residence that count exclusively toward the minor (i.e., are not double-counted with the advanced core baskets, major, or another minor).  Minor owners should strive to create coherent course sequences that have the potential to enrich the education of the greatest possible number of cadets.  Initial courses within minors shall not have prerequisites that are over and above the core curriculum (inclusive of advanced core options) which are not already contained within the minors' course sequence.  	2-7.5. INITIAL CHOICE OF PROGRAM 	 Each semester, the faculty hosts Majors’ Night, an event designed to give cadets the opportunity to explore academic programs and talk with program representatives.  While exploring programs, cadets seek advice from their Fourth-Class Advisors.  After selecting a program, cadets should seek help primarily from their academic advisors.  While the information in this chapter may be useful to Fourth-Class Advisors and academic advisors, its purpose is to answer common questions cadets often have regarding academic programs.  2-7.6.  TIMELINE TO DECLARE A MAJOR Cadets may declare a major as soon as they desire; however, academic advisors will highly recommend that cadets wait at least until their second semester. Declaring a major early does not allow cadets to adjust their courses during the first two semesters. Cadets must declare a major by the registration deadline of their third semester. However, several majors require cadets to take courses during their third semesters that are prerequisites for major’s courses. For example, if cadets plan to major in Aeronautical Engineering, Astronautical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mathematics, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, Meteorology, Operations Research, or Physics, they should plan to take Math 243 their third semester if Math 243 (or Math 253) was not taken during the fourth-class year.  If cadets are planning to major in Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cyber Science or Data Science they should declare before the registration deadline of their second semester and plan to enroll in Comp Sci 210 in their third semester.  Fourth-Class Advisors must discuss the requirements for the majors in which cadets have an interest. This information is provided in the course sequence tables for each major listed in this handbook.  Cadets should also attend Majors' Night for in-depth academic program information.  The process of declaring a major, entails deciding on a course of study and scheduling a specific sequence of courses that meets graduation requirements.  Cadets can change their major as long as they have time to meet the major requirements.  However, most majors have required non-core, 200-level courses, so, the longer cadets wait the more difficult changing majors becomes.  Thirdclass cadets will not be permitted to depart on Thanksgiving Break until they have declared an academic major.  2-7.7.  CHANGE OF MAJOR Cadets may change majors at any time with proper coordination and approval from affected departments. Initial selection or change of program should be timed so that no changes need be made for the current semester.  2-7.8.  MAJORS: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  HOW DO I CHOOSE AN ACADEMIC PROGRAM?   Many factors go into deciding what program to choose.  The first question you should ask yourself is, "What do I want to do once I am commissioned?"  Talk to officers in varied career fields.  Ask them what their majors were in college and ask if their majors are enhancing their career efforts.  Remember, your major can dictate what career fields you may be eligible to enter.  Even if your goal is to fly, your major can open or restrict future career opportunities.  Many career fields have specific requirements or are limited in the numbers they accept each year.  Remember, what job you do after commissioning will be determined by Air and Space Force requirements, by your qualifications, and by what you want to do.  For more information concerning careers in the Air and Space Forces, Cadet Personnel (A1A) keeps up-to-date career briefs.  After you have looked at Air and Space Force requirements, consider what courses interest you. As you progress through the curriculum, the courses often become more difficult.  If you are interested in a subject, you will more likely spend the time needed to do well in those courses.  Look to your academic strengths.  Even though you may like a particular major, if you do not do well in those types of courses, it is highly unlikely that you will succeed at that major.  Talk to your Fourth-Class Advisor, Squadron Commander, and AMTs.  They can be the most important people in helping you decide upon a program.  Your Fourth-Class Advisor can direct you to people to talk with about your options.  If you have unanswered questions about a program, find a faculty member with whom you can talk.  One of the best times to do this is during Majors' Night at the beginning of each fall and spring semester. Cadet participation in Majors' Night is voluntary and provides a gathering of faculty from all academic departments, ready to discuss their departments’ offerings and the potential benefits of their programs.  Finally, talk to peers in your squadron, in your classes, in clubs or on teams.  Though "dorm advising" will not provide you with all the information you need to know, it will give you an additional perspective on the programs offered.  HOW DO I DECLARE A MINOR?    You should declare your intention to complete the requirements of a minor as early as possible.  First, contact the department administering the minor.  After discussing course requirements, meet with your academic advisor.  The AIC for your academic major can add the minor to your academic program.  To earn a minor, you must complete the specific minor’s requirements and the requirements for your academic major(s).  Cadets may not earn a disciplinary minor in the same discipline as one’s disciplinary major.  HOW DO I DECLARE AN ACADEMIC MAJOR?  To declare a major, meet with your academic advisor and communicate your intentions to declare.  Cadets will be assigned an academic advisor from the appropriate academic department, and an entire four year course plan will be registered on-line using COMPASS.  WHAT IF I CHOOSE THE "WRONG" MAJOR?    After you have completed at least one semester in a major, you should have a better understanding of the major. If you find you have chosen the wrong major, you can change majors or options  within the major.  A decision to change a major should not be taken lightly; however, do not keep a program that might put your graduation and commissioning in danger. Talk to your advisor before you make a decision.  Look at your performance in your current program.  Are you doing poorly in the courses because you have difficulty comprehending the subject matter?  Are you studying correctly? Remember, even though you want a specific major, your primary goal should  be to become an Air or Space Force officer, not earn a specific major.  HOW CAN I LOSE MY ACADEMIC MAJOR OR MINOR?   An ARC or the Academy Board may direct you to change your major or drop your minor if you are academically deficient.  When an ARC or the Academy Board removes you from your major or your minor, whether putting you into another major or the Bachelor of Science Program, you have turned your academic program over to them. Often, this happens to cadets who simply choose the wrong major.  You will maintain better control of your academic program by making appropriate and timely decisions.  The Department Head responsible for each major or minor may deny that major or minor to a cadet who does not maintain at least a 2.0 GPA in that major or minor or who has more than one deficient grade in courses used to determine the major’s GPA or minor’s GPA.   CAN I GET MY MAJOR BACK ONCE I HAVE LOST IT?   If you have previously been denied or removed from a major by a Department Head, you may again declare the major after obtaining approval from the Department Head.  If you were ARCdirected to change majors, you may again declare your original major with the ARC Chair’s approval.  MULTIPLE MAJORS OR MINORS   While at the Academy, you may earn more than one major, and/or one or more minors in addition to your major(s).  Your diploma will reflect your major(s).  Your transcript will reflect your major(s) as well as any minor(s).  Individual courses required in multiple majors, or in a major and a minor, count for both, but cadets must meet all requirements for multiple majors and any minor(s).  The following describes criteria for multiple majors and combinations of a major and a minor:  Divisional majors at 134 semester hours (Social Sciences, General Engineering, and Basic Sciences) and another major: The majors must be in separate divisions.  You must complete at least 4 non-core academic courses (≥ 12 semester hours) in residence in excess of the requirements of the major with the highest requirements and must meet all the requirements of both majors.  Two Disciplinary Majors: You must complete at least 4 non-core academic courses (≥ 12 semester hours) in residence in excess of the major's requirements for the major with the greater number of required hours and must meet all requirements of both majors. Those 4 non-core academic courses (≥ 12 semester hours) should uniquely fill requirements in one major but not both majors. For example, a cadet majoring in both Aeronautical Engineering (144 semester  hours) and Applied Mathematics (141 semester hours) would need to complete a total of 156 semester hours in order to be awarded both majors, regardless of which is listed as the primary major and which is listed as the second major.  More Than Two Majors: You may receive a third or additional major, provided the additional major(s) meet(s) the above criteria, with each additional major requiring at least 4 courses (≥12 semester hours) that do not count toward core or other majors’ requirements.   You may earn more than one minor provided: 1) the specified criteria are met for each, and 2) each additional minor contains at least 2 non-core academic courses (6 semester hours) in residence that count exclusively toward the minor (i.e., are not double-counted with the advanced core baskets, major, or another minor).  HOW DO I DECLARE A DOUBLE MAJOR?   To declare a double major, meet first with your current academic advisor to discuss the additional requirements of the second major and how it will impact your academic program.  Next, meet with the AIC of the second major you are declaring.  Your academic advisor will ensure the second major is added to your academic program.  Cadets pursuing double majors must ensure both majors are listed on the academic program summary.  If a discipline has more than one option, you cannot earn a double major in that discipline.  CAN I DECLARE THE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE PROGRAM?   Cadets cannot declare the Bachelor of Science Program (BSP).  The BSP must be recommended by an Academic Review Committee Chair or the Office of Student Academic Affairs and approved by the Vice Dean for Academics.  Interested cadets should discuss the issue with their FourthClass Advisor/academic advisor and a member of the Curriculum Division of Student Academic Affairs (DFVRC).  BSP approval can happen no earlier than the cadet’s third semester.  The expectation is that all cadets will earn a major; the BSP is an exception to this rule to provide an alternate path to graduation for a small number of cadets.  2-7.9.  GOVERNANCE OF ACADEMIC MINORS Any CCP proposing a new academic minor will provide both a list of course requirements and a rationale for those requirements.  The rationale will include an explanation of semester hour minimums and if/how courses that count toward the minor may be “double counted” with the advanced core options and/or an academic major. CCPs for any new academic minors will address  any staffing implications associated with offering that minor as well.  Common requirements for all academic programs apply to academic minors as well, to include programmatic learning outcomes, regular program assessment and review, and continuous program improvement based on the discussion of assessment results.  2-7.10.  ACCREDITATION All graduates are awarded a Bachelor of Science Degree, accredited by The Higher Learning Commission (30 N. LaSalle Street, Suite 2400, Chicago, Illinois 60602-2504, phone (312) 2630456).  All graduates will have BACHELOR OF SCIENCE printed on their diploma. Cadets completing multiple majors will have each appear on their diplomas.  For a limited number of disciplines, associated professional bodies have issued professional accreditation.  The Aeronautical Engineering, Astronautical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Systems Engineering majors are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.  The Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Engineering Chemistry options within the Chemistry major are approved by the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society.  The Computer Science and Cyber Science majors are accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.  The Management major is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Many disciplines have no professional body that  performs the accreditation functions; for those majors, the accreditation by The Higher Learning Commission is the highest possible review.  SECTION 2-8 DISCIPLINARY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY MAJORS AND MINORS  MAJOR/MINOR  Aeronautical Engineering Aerospace Materials Minor Airpower Studies Minor American Studies Minor Astronautical Engineering Basic Sciences Behavioral Sciences Biology Chemistry Civil Engineering Computer Science Cyber Science Data Science Economics Electrical & Computer Engineering English Foreign Area Studies Foreign Language Minors Future Conflict Minor General Engineering Geospatial Science Global Logistics Management Minor High Performance Computing Minor History Humanities Legal Studies Management Mathematics Mechanical Engineering Meteorology Military & Strategic Studies Nuclear Weapons & Strategy Minor Operations Research Philosophy Major / Minor Physics Political Science Pre-Health Professions Minor Quantum Technologies Minor Religion Studies Minor Robotics and Autonomous Systems Minor Social Sciences Space Warfighting Minor Sustainability Minor Systems Engineering  AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING   	THE AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING MAJOR AT A GLANCE: 	Aeronautical Engineering majors at the Academy design, build, and fly next-generation airplanes, jet engines, and hypersonic systems that go to the edge of space.  Aero majors solve tough, novel, and realworld technical problems using supercomputers, high-tech simulation, and state-of-the-art tools such as transonic and supersonic wind tunnels.  If you want to start your career on the leading edge of hypersonic research, this is the place to do it.  Aero majors agree this is a tough, but rewarding, course of study.  As an Aero major, you will study flight control systems, propulsion, aerodynamics, aero structures and materials, flight testing and experimentation with some of the nation’s leading experts in the field.  Most of our students become published authors, some receive patents, and all take part in cutting-edge, real-world research programs.  Our graduates pursue Air and Space Force careers as pilots, test pilots, flight test engineers, astronauts, program managers, developmental engineers, and undergraduate and graduate school professors.   The Aero department faculty and staff pride themselves on supporting you and ensuring your success.  Always!  Ask our students what they think of the faculty, staff, and facilities of the Aero Department.  Our faculty includes test pilots, engineers, and world-class technicians with decades of flight and flight test, research, and classroom teaching experience.  The faculty of the Aero department are internationally recognized experts, published authors, and have contributed directly to the development of new systems for the Air Force. We have world-class facilities and the largest  and best-equipped undergraduate wind tunnel and research laboratory in the world.  Aero majors graduate with Bachelor of Science degree accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), the organization that accredits all post-secondary education programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology in the United States.    In concert with the Academy, the Aero major prepares graduates to be successful Air and Space Force officers with the ability to rapidly acquire knowledge, solve technical problems, lead others, apply ethical and moral standards, exercise critical thinking, and communicate effectively.  The foundation that prepares graduates for attaining the Program Objectives is provided by Student Outcomes.  Attainment of these Student Outcomes prepares graduates to enter the professional practice of engineering.  These relate to the skills, knowledge, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program.  These Student Outcomes are:  an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics; an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors; an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences; an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts; an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives; an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions; and an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.  In the Aeronautical Engineering major, studies in aerodynamics, flight mechanics, propulsion, aircraft structures and materials, and experimental methods prepare cadets to succeed in either of the two course-design sequences, aircraft design or aircraft engine design.  Interested cadets are required to declare the Aeronautical Engineering major no later than the registration deadline in their third semester.  However, late declarations or transfers to this major may be allowed at the beginning of the second-class year provided cadets have completed the following courses before enrolling:  Math 243 (or Math 253), Math 245, Physics 215, Aero Engr 241 and Aero Engr 315. Cadets interested in the Aeronautical Engineering major are encouraged  to discuss issues and concerns with an academic advisor or the Department of Aeronautics Advisor-In-Charge.  The Aeronautical Engineering major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 144.75 Semester Hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab Chem 200 P / C / B Option 2 General Physics II with Laboratory Physics 215 Aero Engr Fundamentals of Aeronautics Aero Engr 210/210S Statistics Probability and Statistics for Scientists and Engineers Math 356 Adv STEM Option Calculus III Math 243/253 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option Differential Equations Math 245  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  46 Semester hours of major's courses: Aero Engr 206 Fundamental Tools for Engineering  	 or Comp Sci 206 	Fundamentals of Programming for Engineers 	 	 or Comp Sci 211 	Introduction to Programming for Scientists and Engineers Math 346 	Engineering Math 	 	 or Engr 346 	Engineering Mathematics with Applications Mech Engr 330 	Mechanics of Deformable Bodies Mech Engr 350 	Mechanical Behavior of Materials Aero Engr 241 	Aero-Thermodynamics Aero Engr 341 	Aeronautical Fluid Dynamics Aero Engr 342 	Computational Aerodynamics Aero Engr 351 	Aircraft Performance and Static Stability Aero Engr 352 	Aircraft Dynamic Stability and Control Aero Engr 361 	Propulsion I Aero Engr 436 	Aircraft Structures, Dynamics and Aeroelasticity Aero Engr 442 	Advanced Aerodynamics Aero Engr 471 	Aeronautics Laboratory Aero Engr 480 	Introduction to Aircraft Engine Design  	 or Aero Engr 481 	Introduction to Aircraft Design 15.

It emphasizes Aerospace Materials—materials used in aircraft, helicopters, spacecraft, and weapon systems—including but not limited to structural materials such as in fuselage, wings, landing gear, and control surfaces; high-temperature materials in propulsion systems, e.g., jet engines; functional materials in sensors and actuators, energy conversion systems, communication systems, avionics, and so forth.  The importance of Materials Science, Engineering, and Technology cannot be overstated. AMM will cover the science, technology, engineering, and art of designing, developing, and selecting sustainable aerospace materials, including i) the science of engineering structures and properties; ii) the processing-structure-property-performance correlation, iii) performance issues, iv) recycling and sustainability, v) materials selection for structures, propulsions, and systems and vi) societal, economic, and environmental aspects.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  AMM mandates a minimum of 15 semester hours: (i) 1 mandatory foundational course, (ii) at least 3 choice courses from one of the TRACKS, and (iii) at least 1 choice humanities & social science course. Up to 9 hours may double-count toward the minor, while at least 6 hours must count exclusively toward the minor. Since this is a cross-disciplinary minor, no more than 2 courses can be taken within one department unless a specific special topic is approved via Mech Engr 499.  Mandatory Foundational Course  Mech Engr 340     Materials Science for Engineers   Structural Materials Track  Aero Engr 482     Aircraft Design  Astro Engr 351     Rocket Propulsion  Chem 465        Chemistry of Advanced Materials  Civ Engr 373      Behavior and Design of Steel Members  Civ Engr 474      Behavior and Design of Concrete Members  Mech Engr 350     Mechanical Behavior of Materials   Mech Engr 440    Physical Metallurgy Mech Engr 445     Failure Analysis and Prevention  Mech Engr 450     Aerospace Composite Materials   Functional Materials Track  Chem 440        Polymer Chemistry  Chem 465        Chemistry of Advanced Materials  ECE 321         Electronics I  ECE 322         Electronics II  ECE 373         Digital VLSI Circuits  Mech Engr 440     Physical Metallurgy Phys 473         Solid State Physics  Computational Materials and Informatics Track  Chem 440        Polymer Chemistry Chem 465        Chemistry of Advanced Materials  Comp Sci 362     Computer Simulation Comp Sci 471     Artificial Intelligence  Math 346         Engineering Math Math 378         Applied Statistical Modeling  Phys 473         Solid State Physics  Cadet designed Custom Materials Tracks will be subject to the DFME Head’s approval.  Choice Humanities/Social Science courses  English 375       Literature, Language, and Science Philos 330        Introduction to the Philosophy of Science History 321       STEM at War: History of Technology and Warfare Creative Art 315    Drawing and Visual Design Mgt 478         Supply Chain Management  MSS 302         Future Conflict and Disruptive Technologies Pol Sci 445       Global Governance and International Relations  	 AIRPOWER STUDIES MINOR  THE AIRPOWER STUDIES MINOR AT A GLANCE:  The newest US Air Force mission statement is "To fly, fight, and win…airpower anytime, anywhere," and official USAF doctrine defines airpower as: "the ability to project military power through control and exploitation in, from and through the air.”  Recognizing this fact, the airpower minor focuses on war in the air domain, as well as the role and capabilities of airpower across the competition continuum—from times of peace to times of armed conflict and war.  The Airpower Studies Minor is for those cadets who want to go beyond the basic understanding of air warfare and airpower capabilities offered in the core curriculum.  It provides cadets exposure to tactical, operational, strategic considerations as well as technological capabilities and limits of the air domain. It adds to the core curriculum’s  foundation with greater depth in the specific application of airpower relevant to any Air Force operational specialty.  Cadets will interrogate the implications of fighting in the air domain and chart a course sequence that inculcates airmindedness, a habit of mind valuable for any Air Force officer. This minor is compatible with any academic major.  	   COURSE REQUIREMENTS:    The Airpower Studies Minor requires a minimum of 15 semester hours.  The student must complete these five courses (15 semester hours) with a grade of “C” or better.  This is an interdisciplinary minor. No more than 2 courses for the minor can be from any one department.  1-2. Two required foundational courses:    History 320      Airpower History   MSS 377        Airpower for Combined Effects  3.

As the Constitution’s “We the people” demands, citizens must know and work with fellow Americans of all backgrounds in order to form a more perfect union; as Master Sun asserts, officers must know their nation-its government, society, and people-just as they know themselves, or risk defeat. Bringing a unique blend of humanistic and social scientific inquiry, cadets will study various ideas about “America” and “Americanness” as it has been defined and experienced across time and by diverse peoples. Ultimately, by synthesizing evidence, theories, and methods drawn from more than one field of study, students will come to better understand the power of interdisciplinary thinking as a necessary tool for formulating their own response to the idea of America that will be the lifeblood of their careers of service to our Air Force and to our nation.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  The American Studies minor requires a minimum of five classes (15 credit hours).

Special emphasis is placed on astrodynamics, aerospace systems design, and control systems.  Thus, the cadet is prepared for duties in the Air or Space Forces with specialization in research, design, development and analysis of space technology and aerospace avionics.  Cadets who successfully complete this major are awarded the degree of Bachelor of Science in Astronautical Engineering, accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.  Interested cadets should declare the Astronautical Engineering major no later than the registration deadline in their second semester.  However, in the event that you are late declaring the Astronautical Engineering major, you must discuss the transfer with an academic advisor from the Department of Astronautics.  In any event, the course outline shown herein reflects the sequence of required major's courses that you must take.  Please see an academic advisor or the Department of Astronautics Advisor-In-Charge to establish your specific course sequence.  To ensure the success of our graduates, we prepare them to attain Program Objectives two to five years after graduation.  These are:  Recognition as successful Air or Space Force officers through demonstration of their ability to: Rapidly acquire required knowledge, Lead others effectively, Effectively apply ethical and moral standards, Improve unit performance by application of organizational skills, Make sound decisions based on critical thinking, and Communicate effectively. Selection for career training on, or ahead of, schedule, and for a progression of assignments of increasing responsibility. A demonstrated ability to solve Air and Space Force technical problems. 4) Success in continuing education.  The foundation that prepares graduates for attaining the Program Objectives is provided by Student Outcomes.  Student Outcomes describe what students must attain prior to graduation.  These relate to the skills, knowledge, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program.  These Student Outcomes are: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics; an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors; an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences; an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts; an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives; an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions; and an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.  Incorporated within these outcomes, Astronautical Engineering majors must demonstrate a knowledge of orbital mechanics, space environment, attitude determination and control, telecommunication, space structures, and rocket propulsion.  In addition, graduates must also demonstrate design competence that includes integration of Astronautical Engineering topics.  The Astronautical Engineering major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 146.75 Semester Hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab Chem 200 P / C / B Option 2 General Physics II with Laboratory Physics 215 Statistics Probability and Statistics for Scientists and Engineers Math 356 Adv STEM Option Calculus III Math 243/253 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option Differential Equations Math 245  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  48 Semester hours of major's courses: Astr Engr 201 	Technology Skills for Astronautics  	      or Comp Sci 211 	(See Supplemental Information 1) Mech Engr 320 	Dynamics 	      or Physics 355 	Classic Mechanics Aero Engr 241 	Aero-Thermodynamics Astr Engr 321 	Intermediate Astrodynamics Math 346 	Engineering Math Engr 341 	Linear Systems Analysis and Design Engr 342 	Linear Control System Analysis and Design 8.

This divisional program is recommended for cadets already declared in either a Basic Sciences or an Engineering disciplinary major who, for a variety of reasons, find the divisional approach more suited to fulfilling graduation requirements.  Since the Basic Sciences major lacks the structure of a disciplinary major, it is generally not an appropriate path for cadets wishing to go to graduate school in a basic sciences field—they will most likely be required to take additional undergraduate courses in the selected discipline prior to entering graduate school.  The Basic Sciences Major must be recommended by the Academic Advisor, endorsed by the Department Head, and approved by the Division Chair.  Alternatively, the Basic Sciences Major may be directed by the Academic Review Committee and coordinated with the Division Chair.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  134.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists or  Advanced Probability and Statistics Math 356 or Math 377 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  36 Semester hours of major’s courses:  There are no specific mandatory Basic Sciences major’s courses, so cadets have tremendous flexibility in designing their program.  Cadets are free to pursue any avenue of interest in the sciences as long as they follow a coherent course of study approved by their advisor and the Basic Sciences AIC and satisfy the depth and breadth requirements below.  Depth Requirements: At least 18 semester hours at the 300- or 400-level.  Special Topics (495) or Independent Study (499) courses from the four departments in the Basic Sciences Division may be included. Distribution Requirements: At least 24 total semester hours earned through courses taught by the four departments in the Basic Sciences Division.  Basic Sciences majors must satisfy both of the following provisions under this requirement.  A course may not be simultaneously counted toward both distribution requirements, nor may it simultaneously satisfy a core and distribution requirement. At least 12 of these 24 semester hours must comprise a coherent course of study from any of the disciplines in the Basic Sciences Division (including interdisciplinary majors). At least 12 of these 24 semester hours must consist of one non-core course from each of the primary Basic Sciences disciplines (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics).  The P/C/B option course not used to satisfy the core must be taken and will be counted towards this requirement.

Therefore, your success in any field depends largely on your understanding of yourself, others, and how groups of people work together. The Behavioral Sciences major lays the foundation for this understanding and allows cadets the opportunity to map a path of study through a diverse menu of courses aligned with their professional and educational goals.  The mission of Department of Behavioral Sciences and Leadership (DFBL) is to develop cadets and faculty as inclusive leaders of character able to address the complex challenges of current and future conflict through a human-centric approach that is enabled by our delivery of world-class education and scholarship in psychology, sociology, and human factors/systems engineering.  To accomplish this mission we must: Apply a Comprehensive Understanding of Human Behavior: We offer a thorough, scientific understanding of human behavior, interactions, and systems, enabling the creation of innovative solutions and fostering effective leadership at individual, system, and societal levels. Develop Innovative and Bold Thinking: We develop the innovative and bold thinking necessary to solve complex societal and future conflict challenges, ensuring our leaders are equipped for 21st-century great power competition.  Foster Personal and Professional Growth: We intentionally foster the personal and professional development of ourselves, our colleagues, and our cadets, ensuring a continuous journey of learning and improvement. Cultivate a Culture of Care and Respect: We actively create and maintain a supportive environment that values each individual and that supports physical and mental health, social connectedness, psychological safety, and mutual respect. Promote Human-Centered Leadership for a Technological Force: We prepare leaders to advance and unite people, teams, and technology, emphasizing a human-centered approach to leading in the technologically advanced Air and Space Forces.  As you can see, Behavioral Sciences prepares our graduates to enter a wide variety of career fields in the Air and Space Forces, to include pilot training. Behavioral Sciences graduates are highly competitive for the Intel, Security Forces, Force Support, and Special Investigations (OSI) fields. It is important to note that Behavioral Sciences is the only degree at the Academy that qualifies cadets for the Information Operations career field.  Behavioral Sciences is also one of the top majors for Health Professionals. The following health profession concentrations are available for Behavioral Science majors: Pre-Med            - Pre-Nursing           - Dental Physician Assistant     - Physical Therapy        - Clinical Psychology - Aerospace Physiology -  Social Work  Notably, DFBL will count, up to three health profession courses toward Behavioral Sciences Electives under both the Psychology and Sociology Concentrations, and two under the Human Factors Concentration. Cadets are encouraged to use their two Academy electives to fulfill other health profession course requirements. This flexibility allows cadets to develop a deeper understanding of human behavior and social processes through their Behavioral Sciences curriculum and at the same time gain vital knowledge necessary to their desired health profession, all the while counting health profession courses toward their Behavioral Sciences degree. Cadets looking to pursue these concentrations should contact DFBL’s Advisor-in-Charge for concentration requirement information. Cadets interested in any health profession concentration should coordinate with a Health Professions Advising Center (HPAC) advisor located within the Departments of Chemistry and Biology for additional registration information.   All cadet majors will choose one of three concentrations to gain depth in a specific discipline:  Psychology Concentration: This concentration explores the scientific study of behavior and mental activity from the individual perspective. Coursework emphasizes the rigorous implementation of the scientific method: those aspects foundational to laboratory study, as well as more modern applied focuses. Psychological courses are the conceptual groundwork for those interested in clinical and counseling, as well as the study and practice of leadership. This concentration is an excellent choice for students wanting to learn more about many topics introduced in Beh Sci 110 and as preparation for students seeking a graduate degree in most psychology disciplines.  Sociology Concentration: Sociology concentration is the study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behavior. Given the complexities and intricacies of societies and the fact that all human behavior is social, the subject matter of sociology ranges from the intimate family to the hostile mob; from organized crime to religious traditions; from the divisions of race, sex, and social class to the shared beliefs of the common culture. This concentration develops cross-cultural competence and the ability to understand and analyze the cultures, beliefs, values, and institutions of foreign societies. The increased cross-cultural competency gained from this concentration will enhance your ability to lead diverse teams in most Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) including pilot, navigator, and other rated career fields.  Human Factors Concentration: Human factors is a scientific discipline that brings together psychology and design to develop effective systems based on human capabilities and limitations. Students will learn methods and concepts from experimental psychology, sensation and perception, cognition, physiology, human-computer interaction, and ergonomics. Applications include aviation, medicine, space, sports, and human-centered design of technology. Cadets will have the opportunity to work with faculty on applications including aviation, medicine, space, sports, virtual reality, eye tracking, and human-centered design technology design. After successfully completing this degree program, cadets will be prepared for graduate work in human factors and ergonomics, human systems integration, human-computer interaction, and related degree programs. NOTE: This concentration is not an accredited engineering degree; cadets interested in graduating with an HF-related accredited engineering degree should consider a Systems Engineering degree with an HF emphasis.  The Behavioral Sciences major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 140.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1 Introductory Biology with Laboratory  Biology 215 P / C / B Option 2 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab or General Physics II with Laboratory Chem 200 or Physics 215 Statistics Introduction to Statistics Math 300 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option Sociology Beh Sci 360 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  42 Semester hours of major's courses:   	1.  	2.  	3. Beh Sci 280 Beh Sci 361 Beh Sci 498 Scientific Method and Research Design Social Problems Senior Capstone in the Behavioral Sciences  	  	4. – 12.

Cadets may use the Academy Options for a variety of purposes: supporting pre-med/health professional coursework, helping to meet a minor's requirements, independent study, pursuing an area of interest, etc.   SUGGESTED COURSE SEQUENCE  //  /    /  	 BIOLOGY  THE BIOLOGY MAJOR AT A GLANCE:   The Biology major prepares cadets to become officers skilled at critical thinking, grounded in the natural world, open to alternative perspectives, and capable of identifying solutions in complex environments. The goal of the Biology major is  to produce leaders who 1) are biologically literate, 2) use scientific thinking as a component of their decision-making process, 3) effectively communicate information to a wide variety of target audiences, and 4) cultivate attitudes and values consistent with biological literacy.  The Biology major offers an effective balance between required foundational courses and cadet selected flexibility.  In addition to the Academy Core, the Biology major comprises 9 core courses (including organic chemistry), as well as 5 electives that include: 3 additional Biology courses, 1 Basic Sciences course and 1 Academy Option.  The required courses represent and explore the spectrum of biological levels, from the molecules within cells to the organisms within ecosystems; the elective courses allow emphasis in environmental and organismal biology, cellular and molecular biology, and human biology. The strong biological foundation provided by these  required courses, together with the flexibility and specialization provided by the electives, allows Biology majors to tailor an academic program to meet their own interests, to pursue specialized areas of interest, or to prepare for advanced degrees/careers in the health professions (medicine, dentistry, nursing, physician assistant) or in the Biomedical Sciences Corps (bioenvironmental engineering and physical therapy). Upon graduation, Biology majors enter a wide variety of career  fields in the Air and Space Forces.  The most effective approach to the Biology major involves some early intentional scheduling of Academy Core courses.  Cadets considering the Biology major should enroll in Chem 100 and Chem 200 in their fourth class year.  Biology 215 is a prerequisite for the Biology majors' courses, and should be taken by the fall semester of the third-class year.  However, if transferring from another major, a cadet can still complete a Biology major in two years.

The three tracks in chemistry are recommended for those who are interested in chemical, biochemical, or advanced materials research and applications, or medical career fields.  They provide fundamental knowledge in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry and allow the cadet to select a specialized degree track for indepth study.  The tracks in chemistry emphasize the use of the laboratory methods for reinforcement of lecture material and individual research projects.  All three American Chemical Society (ACS) certified tracks prepare cadets for a junior officer position in research, development, or graduate training.  A junior officer may be assigned to Air Force Labs, such as the High Explosive Research and Development Facility (HERD), the Directed Energy Lab, the Propulsion Directorate, or the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate.  Additionally, cadets graduating with one of the chemistry tracks are very competitive for medical school, dental school, bioenvironmental engineering, pilot, navigator, aircraft maintenance, intelligence, and a host of other operational and support career fields.  All cadets interested in the medical career fields or a science major to include the Chemistry, Engineering Chemistry, Biochemistry tracks, and Biology major should enroll in Chem 100 in the 4° fall, followed by Chem 200 in the 4° spring to allow proper sequencing for medical school application timelines.  Cadets should declare one of the American Chemical Society approved Chemistry tracks prior to the fall semester of their third-class year. Cadets can still complete one  of the Chemistry tracks if they declare in the fall of their 3° year, however, course sequencing will not be ideal. Cadets with validation credit will have the opportunity to take additional courses at  the Academy, and they will be strongly encouraged to take any additional courses in the Humanities and Social Sciences Divisions to better support achievement of the Academy outcomes. To discuss the Chemistry major, contact the DFCH advisor-in-charge.   The Chemistry major tracks are designed such that, by completion of our multi-disciplinary curriculum, our graduates shall demonstrate that they have attained the following Student Learning Outcomes:  master the fundamental principles of chemistry; perform laboratory-based experimentation to reinforce chemical principles and to develop laboratory technique; solve problems in the laboratory and classroom to improve scientific reasoning; communicate chemistry using written and oral delivery methods; and learn in a supportive environment where faculty plan and utilize the best resources in student engagement.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  143.75 – 150.75 Semester hours  94 - 95 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses.   Chemistry Track     Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab Chem 200 P / C / B Option 2 General Physics II with Laboratory Physics 215 Statistics Probability and Statistics for Scientists and Engineers Math 356 Adv STEM Option Analytical Chemistry Chem 222 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1*   Cadets in the Chemistry Track should take an Advanced Sociocultural Option to fulfill the     Advanced Open Option.  Biochemistry Track     Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab Chem 200 P / C / B Option 2 General Physics II with Laboratory Physics 215 Statistics Probability and Statistics for Scientists and Engineers Math 356 Adv STEM Option Analytical Chemistry Chem 222 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option Introductory Biology with Laboratory Biology 215*   Biology 215 is an approved requirement for the Advanced Open Option for the Biochemistry     track.

As such, civil engineering is one of the broadest of the engineering disciplines, encompassing many interdependent technical specialties. As a civil engineer, you will plan, design, and supervise the construction of a wide variety of facilities in the natural and built environment, such as bridges, buildings, tunnels, highways, transit systems, dams, airports, irrigation projects, water distribution networks, waste collection and treatment facilities, and offshore structures.  You will use technology's newest applications.  Civil engineers are leading users of state-of-theart computer methods in design, construction, project scheduling, and cost control.  Civil engineers are problem solvers, meeting challenges like providing safe drinking water, preventing pollution, restoring deteriorating infrastructure, easing traffic congestion, providing resilient energy supplies, responding to disasters like floods and earthquakes, promoting sustainable development, and community planning. Additionally, civil engineers may perform work in engineering forensics,  analyzing failed structures to determine cause of failure.  As you develop your skills, you can move into engineering management, oversee the completion of entire projects, and work closely with architects, owners, contractors, government officials, and others involved in all aspects of construction to make people’s lives better.  What is civil engineering like in the Air Force? The Air Force civil engineer career field is also broad, including civil and environmental engineers, as well as architects, electrical engineers, and mechanical engineers.  Typically, an Air Force civil engineer officer can expect to work at both base and headquarters level assignments.  The civil engineer at the base level is responsible for the sustainable construction and maintenance of all facilities; mechanical, electrical, and waste disposal systems; hazardous waste management, runways, and roads.  Accordingly, Air Force civil engineering requires many specialties.  Your tasks may include technical design, project planning and programming, and possibly managing the maintenance work force of civilian and military personnel.  At a headquarters level, your expertise is required to plan, manage, and direct the civil engineering efforts at larger scales across the Air and Space Forces.  As a civil engineer, you will have the opportunity to contribute across the world – nearly every USAF and USSF garrison and contingency installation has civil engineers assigned to support the mission!  If your goal is to improve people’s lives and their interaction with the built and natural environment, if you like science and mathematics, and are curious about how things work, then perhaps civil engineering is the major for you.  The civil engineering major is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.  Upon graduation, you earn a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering. A graduate with a civil engineering degree is  eligible for a civil engineer, general engineer, bioenvironmental engineer, developmental engineer, rated, or various other Air Force and Space Force Specialty Codes.  To ensure the success of our graduates, we prepare them to attain Program Educational Objectives two to five years after graduation.  These are: Recognition as successful Air or Space Force officers through demonstration of their ability to: Rapidly acquire required knowledge, Lead others effectively, Effectively apply ethical and moral standards, Improve unit performance by application of organizational skills, Make sound decisions based on critical thinking, and Communicate effectively. Selection for career training on, or ahead of, schedule, and for a progression of assignments of increasing responsibility, A demonstrated ability to solve Air and Space Force technical problems, 4) Success in continuing education, and 5) Success in contingency operations.  The foundation that prepares graduates for attaining the Program Educational Objectives is provided by Student Outcomes.  Student Outcomes describe what students must attain prior to graduation.  These outcomes relate to the skills, knowledge, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program.  These are: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics; an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors; an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences; an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgements, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts; an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives; an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgement to draw conclusions; and an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.  Incorporated within these outcomes, civil engineering majors must demonstrate knowledge of fundamental concepts of civil engineering commonly applied to solve the types of complex, multidisciplinary problems they will face as Air or Space Force officers.  In addition, graduates must demonstrate design competence that includes integration of construction processes.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 143.75 Semester Hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses.    Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1 Introductory Biology with Laboratory or General Physics II Biology 215 or Physics 215 P / C / B Option 2 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab Chem 200 Statistics Probability and Statistics for Scientists and Engineers Math 356 Adv STEM Option Calculus III Math 243/253 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option Differential Equations Math 245  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  45 Semester hours of major's courses:  Civ Engr 330 	Elementary Structural Analysis Civ Engr 351 	Civil Engineering Practices – Field Engineering 	 	 	(taken 1st  period of 2° summer) Civ Engr 361 	Fundamental Hydraulics Civ Engr 362 	Introduction to Environmental Engineering Civ Engr 372 	Behavior and Analysis of Structures Civ Engr 385 	Project Management and Contract Administration  Civ Engr 390 	Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering Civ Engr 451* 	Capstone 1 Civ Engr 452 	Capstone 2 Civ Engr 461* 	Hydraulic Design Civ Engr 485* 	Construction Engineering and Management Civ Engr 488 	Pavement Design and Rehabilitation Civ Engr 405 	Civil Engineering Seminar Structural Design Option (See Supplemental Information 1) 15.

Individuals and institutions have limited resources which forces them to make tradeoffs. Economists employ the scientific method to formulate theories, gather data, and analyze these tradeoffs to recommend optimal decisions, make predictions about behavior, and evaluate policy effectiveness. The strength of the U.S. economy contributes directly to our national defense. Both the Air and Space Forces rely on industry partners to develop and provide military platforms and capabilities. Our nation uses economic tools to support our allies and thwart our enemies.  The course of study includes a foundational sequence of core courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics. Microeconomics is the study of resource allocation at the producer and consumer levels. It includes an investigation of government policies that can help or hinder the efficiency of market outcomes. Macroeconomics aggregates market results to study economies at the national level. Courses in macroeconomics can also focus on international and regional issues that influence economies. Econometrics is used at all levels of economics to evaluate theories and policy outcomes using statistical and data science techniques.  The economics program is designed to develop officers who can: Apply the economic way of thinking to analyze problems, Evaluate the strengths and limitations of economic analysis, Collect and analyze economic data to recognize trends, test economic theories, and evaluate economic arguments; and Effectively communicate economic concepts and analyses.  Program electives allow cadets to apply quantitative economic methods to focus on business, finance, international economics, public policy, and other fields of applied economics. Cadets develop analytic and empirical skills necessary to solve a wide range of problems such as resource allocation, production efficiency, incentive design, and policy evaluation. The economics major develops critical thinking and problem-solving skills and is widely recognized as a solid background for careers as leaders and practitioners in a wide range of fields including data science, technology, business, education, government, and law.  Officers with a background in economics will find themselves well prepared to serve as leaders in the Air and Space Forces. Commanders are required to lead people, execute missions, improve organizations, and manage resources. The study of economics will provide a theoretical and empirical framework to understand incentives, production, policymaking, and resource allocation.  The Economics major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.   COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 140.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option Systems Analysis Ops Rsch 310 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  42 Semester hours of major's courses: Required Economics Courses (9 courses – 27 Sem Hrs) Econ 332 	Intermediate Microeconomics I: Competitive Markets Econ 333 	Intermediate Microeconomics II: Market Failures & Advanced Topics Econ 350 	Intermediate Macroeconomics Econ 361        Econometric Research Methods and Statistical Tools Econ 365 	Econometrics I Econ 465 	Econometrics II Econ 450 	International Economics Econ 440 	Development of Economic Thought Capstone 	Econ 480 or Econ 482  Economics Electives (4 courses – 12 Sem Hrs)  Economics Elective #1 Economics Elective #2  Any of the following courses may fill Economics Electives #1 & #2 Econ 340 Economics of Inequality Econ 351 Comparative Economic Systems Econ 367 Industrial Organization Econ 377 Financial Markets * Econ 411 Introduction to Game Theory * Econ 422 Labor Economics Econ 447 Quantitative Economic Methods * Econ 454 Economics of Development and Conflict Econ 466 Advanced Econometrics Econ 473 Public Economics Econ 475 Money, Banking, and Financial Institutions Econ 476 Economics of Sports Econ 477 Economics of Inequality Econ 480 Defense Economics (if not filling major requirement #9) Econ 481 Econ 495 Econ 499 Soc Sci 420 Soc Sci 444 Applied Economic Research Capstone I Special Topics Independent Study in Economics Law and Economics International Political Economy  Or any other Economics elective that the department creates in the future  Economics Elective #3 Economics Elective #4  In addition to the above courses, any course from the list below may fill Economics Electives #3 & #4. Law 340 Business Law Math 243/253 Calculus III / Advanced Placed Calculus III * Math 245 Differential Equations * Math 320 Foundations of Mathematics * Math 340 Discrete Mathematics * Math 342 Numerical Analysis * Math 344 Applied Linear Algebra * Math 359 Design and Analysis of Experiments * Math 360 Linear Algebra * Math 366 Real Analysis I Math 378 Applied Statistical Modeling Mgt 337 Managerial Finance Mgt 341 Financial Accounting Mgt 342 Managerial Accounting Mgt 375 Marketing Analysis Mgt 382 Investments Ops Rsch 311 Determinate Models * Ops Rsch 312 Probabilistic Models * Ops Rsch 421 Capstone in Operations Research I * Ops Rsch 422 Capstone in Operations Research II * Philos 200 Introduction to Philosophy Philos 370 Introduction to Symbolic Logic Soc Sci 483 Principles of Negotiation Sys Engr 301 Project Engineering Sys Engr 310 Introduction to Systems Engineering *  Academy Option (1 course – 3 Sem Hrs) Academy Option: any course taught for credit under the supervision of the Dean of the Faculty, Commandant of Cadets, the Director of Athletics, or the 306 FTG.

The Air and Space Forces’ increasing reliance on electronic surveillance, electronic warfare, cyber warfare, advanced communication systems, and modern computers has created an insatiable demand for Electrical and Computer Engineers. The ECE major prepares the  student with a deep understanding of the basic principles of modern electronic systems such as "smart" computer-guided munitions, advanced "fly-by-wire'' aircraft, radio systems capable of communicating through hostile electronic jamming environments, terrain-following radar, and much more.  As an Air or Space Force Electrical and Computer Engineer, you will combine your creativity and analytic ingenuity to optimize existing electronic systems, as well as design new systems that have not yet even been conceived.  Air and Space Force officers who understand these emerging technologies can use their expertise to gain a "combat edge" over our adversaries. If you want to  help the Air and Space Forces develop new and better techniques to accomplish their missions, this major may be for you.  Required coursework in the ECE major includes the core curriculum and courses that apply physics, mathematics, and computer science, such as electrical and electronic circuit and systems analysis, computer systems, signal processing, electromagnetic fields and waves, wireless communications, and electrical power systems.  The ECE curriculum culminates in a two-semester capstone design course where seniors work on a team, building on their coursework to design an electronic system that meets the needs of a real customer.  To ensure the success of our graduates, we prepare them to attain Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) two to five years after graduation.  These PEOs are:  Cadets who major in Electrical and Computer Engineering will have been successful Air or Space Force Officers who have: Applied their engineering, management, and leadership skills in service to our nation; Demonstrated intellectual growth through self-study, continuing education, and professional development; Provided technical leadership and disciplinary knowledge, with a broad understanding of the potential ethical and societal impacts of technology; and Applied engineering methodology and creativity to technological problems while effectively communicating to diverse audiences.  The qualities, or outcomes, of the ECE major that prepare each graduate for attaining these PEOs are the following Student Outcomes (SOs).

Drawing on the resources of evidence and imagination, outstanding leaders deploy the power of narrative to influence people and shape policy.  This is the essence of the Academy English major, where you’ll explore enduring questions; formulate transformative ideas; and read, reflect, communicate, and create.  What is English? Our small, interactive classes are full of big ideas that engage literature, communication, film, creative writing, digital humanities, and artistic creation. We are a community that is open to students of all backgrounds and abilities. English majors are leaders in the Cadet Wing, IC athletes, and members of performance clubs and the Forensics Team. The English major is flexible and pairs well with other majors. English majors have pursued the pre-med track as well as second majors in Legal Studies and Computer Science and minors in Philosophy and Foreign Languages. All senior English majors have a chance to undertake an independent research project through the optional Capstone Experience.  Why English? Skills: One of the most valued and highly sought after aspects of any career or vocation is the ability to communicate effectively and to think critically. In the Air Force and Space Force, wing commanders have identified effective communication as the most vital skill that officers need for a successful career. The imperative to “get it all, get it right, and make it clear” is mission critical, and English majors are often sought out for this level of work. Job Opportunities: As an English major, all Air and Space Force career fields are open to you, except for a few highly specialized fields.  Recent English major AFSCs include pilot (to include ENJJPT), CSO, acquisitions, OSI, maintenance, munitions and missiles maintenance, intelligence, contracting, acquisitions with intelligence OPEX, and space. As General Goldfein points out, “Don’t stop writing. Such is the nature of a profession of arms that debates serious matter. We must engage thoughtfully, humbly, and with mindfulness for operational security.” English is attractive in the civilian  world as well.  Entrepreneurs in the corporate sector and policy leaders within the public sector fit the same mold. As former Google executive Santosh Jayaram put it, “English majors are exactly the people I’m looking for.”  With English as your major, along with the technical training and experience you’ll gain as an officer, you’ll be poised to lead in the Air or Space Force, the civilian sector, and as a citizen. In short, English makes you ready for the world. For more information, visit our departmental website at https://www.usafa.edu/academic/english/, call 333-3930, or set up an appointment with our AIC team.  Majoring in English prepares a student to:  Read closely, with an awareness of the significance of the choices at work in various texts, works of art, and technologies.  English majors will learn how these choices speak with various contexts, including the work itself; related works; the creator’s oeuvre; and broader social, historical, and artistic contexts.  Communicate clearly and eloquently while also articulating complex thinking.  English majors will identify genre-specific conventions of their writing and creation tasks and incorporate evidence, and engage with the ideas of others appropriately according to these conventions.   Think critically, with awareness of one’s own preconceptions, and with broader contextual awareness of cultural, political, and historical factors.  English majors will acquire a growing awareness of multiple backgrounds and perspectives in human interactions; they will have the ability to approach different situations with appropriate understanding and methods.  Know the field of English studies. English majors will gain familiarity with the breadth of English and the arts (e.g. significant literary and cultural periods); creative endeavors; digital humanities; and communication and rhetoric.  The English major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome and Clear Communication Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  140.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses to include the following core substitutes:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option War Stories, or Special Topics in War and Literature English 411, or English 370 Adv Open Option  Choose 1 Advanced Sociocultural Option  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses. 42 Semester hours of major's courses:  One pre-1800 	English 303, 308, or 313 One post-1800 	English 319, 324, or 330 One course focusing on social or cultural   	English 355, 360 or 365 contexts 4-10.

Are you interested in focusing your studies on a particular region of the  world?  Then the Foreign Area Studies (FAS) major may be the right choice for you.  Depending on the foreign language you are studying, you will delve into an interdisciplinary exploration of one of six geo-cultural regions: Africa, Latin America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, or Slavic countries.  You will also select an emphasis from one of three academic disciplines: History, Military & Strategic Studies, or Political Science.  The major offers you a wide selection of courses that includes foreign language, history, military and strategic studies, political science, economics, geospatial science, as well as coursework that incorporates a comparative framework for understanding cross-cultural dynamics.  The academic program leads to a Bachelor of Science Degree in Foreign Area Studies.  In addition, Foreign Area Studies majors may earn an academic minor in a foreign language related to their area of study.  “Language, regional and cultural skills … are critical to mission readiness in today’s dynamic global environment. Our forces must have the ability to effectively communicate with and understand the cultures of coalition forces, international partners, and local populations.” SECDEF Memo “Language Skills, Regional Expertise, and Cultural Capabilities in the DoD”, 10 Aug 2011  Our program’s curriculum is designed such that, by completion of our program, our graduates shall demonstrate that they have attained the following Student Learning Outcomes: Gain an interdisciplinary understanding and achieve relative expertise in a specific region of the world (Africa, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Middle East, or Slavic Region), and in the larger global context in which these regions operate. Achieve a moderate level of fluency in a specific foreign language related to their region of study. Gain understanding and achieve relative expertise in a specific academic track related to the FAS major: history, and military & strategic studies, political science. Achieve cultural competency through study and/or immersion in the culture and language related to their region of study.   The FAS major defines expertise as the ability to perform the following skills:   Conduct research Apply concepts Analyze problems Evaluate options Formulate solutions Communicate information  The Foreign Area Studies major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 140.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics  Choose 1 Soc Sci 311 International Security Soc Sci 212 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  Cadets must complete at least five For Lang courses at the 200-level or higher in the same language to earn the minor 42 Semester hours of major’s courses:  1. – 3.

Enduring Air Force missions continue to promote regional stability, provide humanitarian assistance, encourage emerging democracies, gathering intelligence, and projecting and applying air power when necessary.  Air Force officers in all career fields and specialties will find themselves globally engaged, and such engagement requires global skills. The Foreign Area Studies major is designed to give future officers broad-based, foreign area-related skills for worldwide service commitments.   The FAS Major is a qualifying degree for all rated career fields and a desired major for the Intelligence career field (14N AFSC).  The combined FAS Major and associated Foreign Language Minor can open the way for opportunities such as the Language Enabled Airmen Program (LEAP), graduate school, serving as a Foreign Area Officer (FAO), and competing to become an Olmsted Scholar or an Air Attaché at an embassy abroad. FOREIGN LANGUAGE MINORS  WHAT LANGUAGES ARE TAUGHT AT THE ACADEMY?  You may study Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, or Spanish—eight of the most important languages in the world.  Within each language there is a broad spectrum of courses.  The 100- and 200-level courses, and For Lang 321 and For Lang 322 are primarily skills development courses.  The remaining courses are regarded as enhancement courses and are designed to develop a broader based appreciation of a particular culture, history, and literature, providing additional opportunities to develop and refine your language skills. The following courses comprise the curriculum of the Department of Languages and Cultures (DFLC):  SKILLS DEVELOPMENT COURSES 	For Lang 131/132 	Introduction to the Language, Culture, and Civilization For Lang 221 Intermediate I: Refinement of Language Skills For Lang 222 Intermediate II: Continued Development of Language Skills For Lang 321 Advanced I: Capstone Course for Skills Development For Lang 322 Advanced II: Follow-on Capstone Course for Skills Development  ENHANCEMENT COURSES For Lang 365 For Lang 410 For Lang 420  For Lang 430 For Lang 495 For Lang 499  	 Civilization and Culture  Current Events Introduction to Literature Advanced Studies Special Topics Independent Study (normally offered only to those students who  have completed all courses)  NOTE: After completion of For Lang 365, enhancement courses may be taken out of sequence.  The chart below clarifies the foreign language course sequences: Language Typical Course Sequence    Fall Spring Fall Spring Fall Spring Fall Arabic  131 132 221 222 321 322 365 Chinese  131 132 221 222 321 322 365 French  131 132 221 222 321 322 365 German  131 132 221 222 321 322 365 Japanese  131 132 221 222 321 322 365 Portuguese  131 132 221 222 321 322 365 Portuguese  --- --- 211 212 321 322 365 Russian  131 132 221 222 321 322 365 Spanish  131 132 221 222 321 322 365  COURSE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE MINORS: Cadets majoring in any academic division or discipline may earn a specific foreign language minor provided they meet the DF minor policy requirements, complete five language courses at or above the 200 level (in residence and in the same language with a grade of ‘C’ or better), and complete the requirements for their major.  Cadets who place at or above the 200 level will receive validation credit for up to four language courses.  Regardless of the number of courses validated, no more than two will count towards the minor, leaving a requirement of at least three in-residence courses.  For Lang 400/401 (Cadet Summer Language Immersion Program) and For Lang 402 (language credit for semester abroad) can also fill course requirements for the minor.    HOW CAN I BENEFIT FROM FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY?  Beyond helping to understand culture and broadening your worldview, studying a foreign language can influence your military career.  Our ever-expanding global Air Force mission not only demands increasing foreign language capability to support the national security military strategies but also provides challenging assignment opportunities for those looking for experience and diversification.  Officers with foreign language proficiency are candidates for opportunities such as the Language Enabled Airmen Program (LEAP), graduate school, serving as a Foreign Area Officer (FAO), and competing to become an Olmsted Scholar or an Air Attaché at an embassy abroad.  Moreover, someday you may want to return to the Academy as a language instructor, a position that is both rewarding and career enhancing while providing the opportunity to influence other cadets toward becoming language-qualified Air Force officers. By speaking a foreign language, you become an  "ambassador" helping to shape the opinions that others will have of our country and its armed forces...a crucial role in our increasingly interdependent world.  WHY STUDY A FOREIGN LANGUAGE?  "Americans' scandalous incompetence in foreign languages explains our dangerously inadequate understanding of world affairs.  Our schools graduate a large majority of students whose knowledge and vision stop at the American shoreline, whose approach to international affairs is provincial, whose heads have been filled with astonishing misinformation....The United States requires far more reliable capacities to communicate."  The quote above from the President's Commission on Foreign Languages and International Studies underscores the importance of foreign language.  Learning a foreign language opens up an entirely new world.  The study of languages will further your understanding of other peoples, ourselves, and of our own culture. This understanding is of even greater importance for the military leader  than for the public at large, as evidenced by the following foreign policy experts.  “In the post-Cold War world, the most important distinctions between peoples are no longer ideological, political, or economic.  The distinctions are cultural.”—Samuel P. Huntington  “We need policy-makers, diplomats, and intelligence analysts expert in cultures and languages that encompass all regions of the world.”—Former Senator Sam Nunn  FUTURE CONFLICT MINOR  THE FUTURE CONFLICT MINOR AT A GLANCE: After more than two decades of counterterrorism conflicts both the 2018 and 2022 NDS directed the DOD to prepare for strategic competition with the People’s Republic of China as its pacing challenge and with Russia as an “acute threat.” Recognizing that both the world and DOD priorities have shifted, the Future Conflict minor focuses on creating and cultivating flexible warfighters who are prepared to prevail in conflict no matter what form it may take in the future. In particular, the current sequence of courses in this minor is intended to ground students in the U.S. approach to strategic competition, how the Joint Force can be utilized in the gray zone between war and peace, adversary strategy and doctrine, as well as a classified practicum that will require cadets to put into practice what they have learned throughout the sequence of courses in line with the National Defense Strategy. This minor seeks to further multiple institutional outcomes at USAFA, most notably critical thinking through its “Fiction and Future Conflict” course. The practice of writing and reading fiction is essential to prepare for future conflict. Fiction uniquely engages imagination and is the only art form that allows us to live a life not our own. This ability to imagine and inhabit another person, to see the world from their perspective, is key to everything from developing future war plans and red-teaming to predicting deterrence impacts. The Problems in Strategy and Tactics course allows cadets to work on real-world, classified problems provided by the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, navigate between the open-source and classified world, and then brief their solutions to senior leadership. This is a way to operationalize the lessons cadets have learned in the classroom. The Future Conflict Minor is for those cadets who want to build upon current course offerings to understand how the Joint Force might be used in strategic competition, what the future of conflict might look like, and how our adversaries are attempting to out-maneuver the U.S. and present us with dilemmas in order to win without fighting. This minor is compatible with any academic major.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FUTURE CONFLICT MINOR: The Future Conflict Minor requires 15 semester hours, on a five-course model. Cadets must complete the five courses (15 semester hours) with a grade of “C” or better. Once these courses are completed satisfactorily, or if the cadet has completed three and is registered for the fourth, students may register for “The Problems in Strategy and Tactics” course. This is a classified course in which students solve real-world problems as determined by the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. Up to 3 semester hours may “multiple count” (double, triple, etc., as the case may be) toward this minor and a cadet’s advanced core options and/or major’s requirements through the elective tracks. The sample course schedule is below, in three parts:  I.

It is also a sensible alternative for cadets already declared in a STEM disciplinary major  who, for a variety of reasons, find the divisional approach more suited to fulfilling graduation requirements.  The General Engineering major is not ABET accredited.  The General Engineering major must be recommended by the Academic Advisor, endorsed by the Department Head, and approved by the Division Chair.  Alternatively, the General Engineering Major may be directed by the Academic Review Committee and coordinated with the Division Chair.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 134.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists Math 356 or Math 377 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  36 Semester hours of major’s courses:  Engr Option 	(See Supplemental Information 1) Engr Option 3.

This major offers a diverse and challenging program focusing on contemporary world issues.  A flexible curriculum has been carefully designed to permit either an in-depth or cross-disciplinary approach to the study of geospatial science, maximizing a cadet's ability to design their academic program beyond the core disciplinary requirements.  Course offerings within the discipline represent a broad cross-section of the key geospatial science sub-fields including physical, human, and regional geography, as well as state-of-the-art geographic information processing methods such as digital image processing and geographic information systems.  Furthermore, cadets who wish to complement their major in Geospatial Science with a foreign language minor will be able to achieve both without carrying an academic course overload.  Geospatial Science graduates distinguish themselves from other college graduates by the conceptual framework in which they view the world.  They use an inherently geospatial approach to interpret landscapes by applying knowledge of culture, physical processes, and digital modeling techniques to evaluate the effects of location, scale, and place.  Geospatial Science graduates will demonstrate geospatial analysis through mastery of the following skills: Formulate a geospatial question; Describe the relevant physical and/or human spatial data needed to answer a geospatial question; Acquire usable relevant geospatial data; Process geospatial data to produce a useable and relevant result; Interpret the patterns, processes, and/or interrelationships represented by geospatial data/information, and Effectively defend your interpretation or recommendation.  The Geospatial Science major provides excellent preparation for any assignment in the Air and Space Forces.  The major also helps cadets develop international insight and cultural understanding of the battle space.  Most Geospatial Science majors become pilots, intelligence officers, or special tactics officers.  The Geospatial Science major also offers cadets the opportunity to earn the Geospatial Intelligence Certificate, an academic credential administered by the United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation. This credential better positions Academy cadets for future employment in military or civilian intelligence agencies.  Cadets who excel in this program are eligible to compete for scholarships to graduate school.  These scholarships include not only the prestigious national scholarships, such as the Rhodes, Fulbright, and Marshall, but the Academy Graduate Scholarship Program, in which graduates are sponsored by the Air Force Institute of Technology to earn a master's degree from a civilian institution. The Geospatial Science major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  140.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  42 Semester hours of major’s courses:  Foundational Course (all required):  Geospatial Techniques Geo 310 Map Design and Graphic Communication  	 Geo 340 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems  	 Geo 382 Remote Sensing and Imagery Analysis  	  Human Geography Geo 250 Human Geography: A Global Cultural Awareness  Geo 412 World Cultural Geography Physical Geography  Physical Geography Geo 351 Physical Geography  Geo 353 Geomorphology   Further Depth in Geospatial Science (any 4 courses required; 8. – 11.)  Geospatial Techniques 	Geo 385 	Applied UAS Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 	Geo 440 	Advanced Geospatial Analysis* 	Geo 482 	Advanced Remote Sensing* Human Geography 	Geo 360 	Economic Geography 	Geo 366 	Introduction to Urban Planning  	Geo 375 	Geography of International Conflict  	Geo 380 	Geography of Travel and Culture Physical Geography 	Geo 355 	 	Field Experience in the Geosciences 	Geo 452 	 	Physical Geography of Volcanic Landscapes 	Meteor 320  	Introduction to Meteorology and Aviation Weather  	Meteor 352   	Climatology Environmental, Social, and Economic Sustainability  Civ Engr 356   Introduction to Sustainability  Econ 340      Economics of Inequality 	Geo 360 	     Economic Geography 	Geo 365 	     Sustainability and Resilience in Practice  Other Geospatial Science Courses 	Geo 488 	 	Geospatial Intelligence* 	Geo 495 	 	Special Topics in Geosciences  	Geo 498 	     Reserach in Geospatial Science 	Geo 499 	     Independent Study For Lang 365 Other Geo prefixed, Foreign Area Studies prefixed, or regional courses as offered**  Synthesis or Capstone (1 course required; 12.) 	Geo 491 	Capstone Seminar in Geospatial Science: Military Geography*  OR 	Geo 497 	Capstone Research in Geospatial Science*  Academy Option (2 courses required; 13. – 14.)  Any course offered for academic credit  *Denotes required courses to obtain the Geospatial Intelligence Certificate. ** Regional courses without Geo prefix require Geospatial Science AIC approval  	 SUGGESTED COURSE SEQUENCE /  THE GEOSPATIAL INTELLIGENCE (GEOINT) CERTIFICATE AT A GLANCE:  WHY PURSUE A CERTIFICATE IN GEOSPATIAL INTELLIGENCE?  Accurate intelligence is critical to the warfighter to achieve mission success.  The field of intelligence incorporates the collection, analysis, and exploitation of multiple forms of information.  GEOINT addresses the collection, analysis, and exploitation of geospatial data.  Examples of geospatial data, which contain a location on the Earth, include imagery, maps, census data, GPS coordinates, and digital models of the Earth.  GEOINT is critical to military operations and there is currently a scarcity of GEOINT-educated individuals.  The GEOINT Certificate Program at the Academy is constructed in coordination with federal and industry experts via the United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation (USGIF)* and prepares cadets as GEOINT-skilled critical thinkers and leaders.  The GEOINT Certificate requires completion of the following courses: Comp Sci 110 	Introduction to Computing and Cyber Operations Law 220 	Law for Department of the Air Force Officers Philos 210 	Ethics Geo 310 	Map Design and Graphic Communication Geo 340 	Geographic Information Systems Geo 382 	Remote Sensing and Imagery Analysis Geo 440 	Advanced Geospatial Analysis Geo 482 	Advanced Remote Sensing Geo 491 	Capstone Seminar in Geospatial Science Geo 497 	Capstone Research in Geospatial Science 11.

Logistics has always played a critical role in whether conflicts are won or lost and future competitions and conflicts will also be won or lost on the backbone of logistics. The Global Logistics Management minor focuses on the fundamentals of logistics, to include supply chain management, transportation, sustainability, information analytics, and control. The skills gained by graduates who complete the minor will equip them to handle the ever changing speed, demands, security, and interdependencies of logistics, which touch and enable nearly every element of the Air Force, and enhance a greater understanding of the function of logistics in any academic discipline.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:    The Global Logistics Management Minor requires a minimum of 15 semester hours. The student must complete all courses with a grade of "C" or better. This is an interdisciplinary minor.  No  more than 3 courses for the minor can be from any one department.  Three required foundational courses: Civ Engr 356    Introduction to Sustainability* Mgt 476        Logistics and Transportation Management  	Mgt 478 	 Supply Chain Management  Choose at least one of the following analytic options:   Geo 440        Advanced Geospatial Analysis    Math 378       Applied Statistical Modeling    Mgt 391        Data-Driven Decision Making   Ops Rsch 310    Systems Analysis*  Choose at least one of the following breadth options:   Comp Sci 362    Computer Simulation   Comp Sci 471    Artificial Intelligence   Econ 374       Survey of International Economics    Econ 423       Managerial Economics   Econ 480       Defense Economics   Geo 340        Introduction to Geographic Information Systems    Geo 360        Economic Geography History 369 	Globalization: The History of People, Products, Ideas, and Systems in Motion   Mgt 477        Operations & Project Management   Mgt 498        International Management   MSS 421       International Power Projection   Pol Sci 445      Global Governance and International Institutions    Soc Sci 444     International Political Economy   Soc Sci 483     Principles of Negotiation*   Sys Engr 336    Engineering Economics and Financial Management  *These courses are also in the Core Advanced Choices Basket  	 HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING MINOR  THE HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING MINOR AT A GLANCE:  High Performance Computing is becoming increasingly important in many aspects of our lives. For example, simulations of multiscale, multi-physics problems such as modeling and simulation of hypersonic and space vehicles or modeling of multiple earth system components to increase fidelity and skill of weather and climate predictions require tremendous computational resources. Other examples  include extremely short design analysis cycles and analyses of increasingly complex systems and processes (e.g. in biological/biomedical applications), large-scale, heterogeneous data analytics, or comprehensive situational awareness. In the end, the desire to transform data into knowledge,  insights, and actions, is resulting in data-intensive application workflows across all of science and engineering, requiring High Performance Computing.  The High Performance Computing Minor will provide interested cadets a better understanding of modern high performance computing systems, preparing them to thrive in any career requiring advanced knowledge of these computing systems and their usage.  The High Performance Computing Minor requires students to gain an understanding of computing system architectures and then allows flexibility to tailor their course of study to meet their individual interests, align it with their major, and maximize their academic strengths.  The breadth of courses available in this minor makes this minor compatible with any academic major.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:   The High Performance Computing Minor requires a minimum of 15 semester hours.  The student must complete these five courses (15 semester hours) with a grade of “C” or better.  There are four tracks available in this Minor.  The intent of the High-Performance Computing Minor is that cadets take courses they would not normally take but which may serve as a complementary skillset for advanced computational techniques within their discipline.  To earn the minor, cadets are required to complete at least two courses beyond the requirements for their major.                   Each of the four tracks below requires 5 courses that form a coherent body of study in a particular focus on high performance computing and cumulates with a capstone experience in a high performance computing application.  Each track has been designed so that any cadet NOT enrolled in the corresponding major can complete the requirements for the track.  The requirements for each track are listed below.   Computer Science Track¹ˈ²  Math 340         Discrete Mathematics Comp Sci 220      Data Structures and Systems Programming Comp Sci 362      Computer Simulation Comp Sci 380      Design and Analysis of Algorithms Comp Sci 471      Artificial Intelligence  Computer Engineering Track³  Four required courses ECE 281         Digital Design and Computer Architecture ECE 382         Embedded Computer Systems I ECE 383         Embedded Computer Systems II ECE 485         Advanced Computer Architecture  Choose one of the following options: Comp Sci 362      Computer Simulation ECE 386         AI Hardware Applications  Computational Aerodynamics⁴  Engr 346/Math 346  Engineering Math Aero Engr 241      Aero-Thermodynamics Aero Engr 341      Aeronautical Fluid Dynamics Aero Engr 342      Computational Aerodynamics Aero Engr 472      Advanced Computational Aerodynamics  High Performance Data Analytic⁵, 6  Math 340         Discrete Mathematics Math 344/Math 360  Applied Linear Algebra / Linear Algebra Ops Rsch 311      Deterministic Models Comp Sci 471      Artificial Intelligence Capstone Experience  – This track requires completion of Math 356/Math 377 and Comp Sci 210/212 as prerequisites. These courses would count towards Core STEM Advanced and Advanced Open Choice requirements.  – This track as defined currently does not have a clear “capstone experience” focused on HPC application.  It addresses parallel computing and applications, but might not address these topics at scale of HPC.  – This track requires completion of Math 356/Math 377 and Comp Sci 210/212 as prerequisites. These courses would count towards Core STEM Advanced and Advanced Open Choice requirements.  – This track requires completion of Math 243/Math 253 and Math 245 as prerequisites.  These courses would count towards Core STEM Advanced and Advanced Open Choice requirements.  5 – This track requires completion of Math 243/Math 253 and Ops Rsch 310 as prerequisites.  These courses would count towards Core STEM Advanced and Advanced Open Choice requirements.  6 – This track does not have a predefined “capstone experience” focused on HPC application.  This requirement can be satisfied with an Ops Rsch 495/499 or with the approval of the High Performance Minor AIC and the Department Head of an instructor offering an appropriate capstone course, 495, or 499.  A 495 or 499 course offered by any department may meet this requirement if a preponderance of the 495 or 499 involves a project using the high performance supercomputing resources from the Academy’s High-Performance Computing Research Center. HISTORY  THE HISTORY MAJOR AT A GLANCE: For over two thousand years, history has been a warrior's constant companion, a guide for leading, deciding, and acting wisely in challenging and uncertain times.  The study of history, however, provides no static model or formula for action.  Instead, the examination of the human condition in breadth, depth, and context provides leaders with a diverse and dynamic toolkit to facilitate success in an ever-changing and often irrational world. History is a unique discipline because it instills powerfully logical, but not rigid, habits of  mind; it recognizes that humans, individually and collectively, primarily shaped the past and will shape the future; and it is based on the fundamental belief that no event or decision is exactly the same as any other, although discernable patterns exist.  Rather than engaging in the futile quest to predict the future, historians see a deep, nuanced, and balanced understanding of the past as an essential foundation for effectively confronting complex and ambiguous situations. In short, the  study of history sharpens judgment by allowing one to transcend personal experience.  Majoring in history prepares a student to: Understand factual historical data.  Gather and analyze historical sources comparatively and in context.  Formulate evidence-based, critical interpretations of appropriately contextualized historical events, processes, and people. Communicate critical interpretations of history clearly and cogently.  The History major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  History is a qualifying degree for all rated career fields (including Pilot, RPA, CSO, ABM, Space Operations & Cyberspace Operations) and is a desired major for the Intelligence career field (14N AFSC).  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  140.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics  Choose 1 World History  History 300S (optional) Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  42 Semester hours of major's courses:  1.

The program is jointly administered by the Departments of English (including the Creative Arts faculty), Foreign Language, History, and Philosophy.  There are two dimensions to the program.  First, students take a set of courses that are foundational to the Humanities from across the contributing departments.  Second, students select among a variety of electives in order to construct a multi-disciplinary educational pathway tailored to their specific interests and aspirations.  Graduates with the Humanities major will provide the Air Force with officers with unique talent and experience in conceptual integration, lateral thinking, and strategic sensitivity.  Academy graduates who major in Humanities will: Analyze, evaluate, and formulate conceptual thinking related to a variety of references in thought, literature, music, and art; Develop deeper understanding of and appreciation for the human condition, human cultures, and human societies; Develop sophisticated oral and written communication skills, ideally as well in a foreign language; and Develop higher-order critical reasoning and creative thought skills.  The Humanities major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  140.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option War Stories English 411 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  42 Semester hours of major's courses:  1.

For example, Pol Sci 300 fulfills the       Humanities RMCE requirement for former ForArStu majors. 2. – 3. Two Creative Arts courses (310 or higher) 4. – 6. Humanities distribution (one of each): Any 300- or 400-level English course (with the exception of English 411, 489, or 490) Any 300- or 400-level non-core course offered by DFHI  Any non-core course offered by DFPY 7. – 14. Humanities options: 24 semester hours of courses offered by the Humanities Division and its departments (usually eight courses).  Humanities major advisors are encouraged to use Hum 400S as a capstone unless circumstances such as a semester abroad preclude doing so.  Supplemental Information: Proficiency in foreign language facilitates the study of many disciplines and provides a muchneeded capability in the operational Air Force. To realize these benefits, Humanities majors may  earn a foreign language minor by taking courses at the 200 level and above that double-count for the minor and Humanities options.  	 SUGGESTED COURSE SEQUENCE  Humanities Major 	hrs 	per 	3 	1 	3 	1 	3 	1 	3 	1 	3 	1 	0.5 	2 	15.5 	7 P / C / B Option Aero Engr 315 Math 300 Ldrshp 300 Astr Engr 310 Ldrshp 400 	Hum Option 	3 	1 	Hum Option 	3 	1 Hum Option 	3 	1 	Hum Option 	3 	1 4 	2 	Hum Option 	3 	1 	3 	1 	Hum Option 	3 	1 	3 	1 3 	1 	0.75 	0 0.75 	0 	Phy Ed 	0.5 	2 	Phy Ed 	0.5 	2 	17.25 	8 	16.25 	7 Course Unit Summary Core (29) Major (14) Phy Ed (10) Semester Hour Summary 	Core = 	93.0 Sem Hours Major = 	42.0 	" Phy Ed = 	5.0 	" Total = 140.0 "  LEGAL STUDIES  THE LEGAL STUDIES MAJOR AT A GLANCE:  Increasingly complex legal considerations permeate every aspect of modern life in both the civilian and military environments.  Cadets who choose the Legal Studies major will build expertise in the study of law and its role and function in both American society and the international community.  Cadets will also develop the critical thinking skills that will permit them to identify, understand, and begin to resolve the complex legal and other issues which they will encounter after graduation.  The Legal Studies major is not a "prelaw" major; rather, it is designed to provide cadets an enhanced knowledge of the law and a respect for the rule of law, while intentionally developing critical thinking and clear communication skills that will serve our graduates well both in the Air and Space Forces and beyond.  Cadets who major in Legal Studies enjoy a nearly unmatched level of flexibility and choice in selecting courses.  Cadets must complete fourteen courses in addition to the required academic core curriculum.  Five courses are required for all Legal Studies majors; however, of the remaining nine courses, cadets select seven from a lengthy list of approved Law Options, with the final two courses providing even greater choice (refer to Section C on the next page).  This flexible, choicedriven approach is a critical aspect of our major as it allows cadets to study specific areas in more depth, to expand their world view with broadening courses, and/or provide academic space toward earning a double major or academic minor.   Since the first graduating class of Legal Studies majors in 1990, graduates with the Legal Studies major have successfully entered Pilot and other rated career fields, as well as nearly every other non-technical career field in the United States Air and Space Forces, such as Intelligence, Contracting, Acquisitions, Public Affairs, Personnel, Office of Special Investigations, Security Forces, Maintenance, Logistics, Cyberspace Operations, and Space Operations, to name a few.  Graduates have also attended law school and are now serving as Judge Advocates (JAGs) for the Air and Space Forces.  In fact, pursuant to a program known as U-ELP, the Secretary of the Air Force may authorize graduates to attend an American Bar Association approved law school following graduation from the Academy. Full completion of this program ultimately leads to service as an Air Force JAG.  Finally, if you are a cadet who enjoys competition beyond the fields of friendly strife, the Department of Law and the Legal Studies major sponsor a variety of nationally and internationally respected competitive academic teams.  Our Mock Trial, Moot Court, Cyber Policy, and three different International Humanitarian Law teams compete against other undergraduate, graduate, and even law school teams at competitions in the U.S. and overseas.  Some of these competition teams are tied to required courses so interested cadets should work with their advisors to ensure they are enrolled in the proper courses.   Cadets interested in becoming a Legal Studies major should ideally take Law 220 during the fall of their third-class year (or even spring of their fourth-class year).  While we have numerous cadets who declare during the spring and even summer of their 3° year, the earlier the better so that cadets can maximize the developmental sequencing of our courses.  The Department of Law’s curriculum is designed around the following Legal Studies Program Goals: Develop officers who can solve legal problems and think critically; Develop officers who can communicate clearly; and Develop officers with knowledge of selected aspects of the law.  The Legal Studies major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 140.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  42 Semester hours of major's courses:  Required Major’s Courses:   Law 221 	Legal Research and Writing Law 321 	Legal Advocacy Law 351 	U.S. Constitutional Law Law 421 	Law for Commanders  Law 485 	Legal Studies Capstone  – 12 Law Options - choose any seven of the following courses:  Law 331 Criminal Law and Procedure Law 340 Business Law Law 360 Law and Literature Law 363 International Law Law 412 Comparative Constitutional Law Law 419 Space Law Law 440 Cyber Law Law 442 Law and Emerging Technology Law 456 National Security Law Law 463 Law 466 Law 480 Law 495 Law 499 Philos 200 Philos 395 Soc Sci 420 Soc Sci 483  Law of War Advanced Law of War Topics Topics in Constitutional Law and Appellate Advocacy  Special Topics (when offered) Independent Study Introduction to Philosophy Philosophy of Law Law and Economics Principles of Negotiation (See Supplemental Information 1)  13.

The Mathematics track provides a broad overview of the foundational subjects of classical and modern mathematics while leaving considerable flexibility to tailor a program of study that meets individual interests.  The degree stresses problem solving, logic, and abstract reasoning while also providing some exposure to various modern applications of mathematics to include programming.  The Applied Mathematics track also provides a solid foundation in diverse mathematical topics, but applies that foundation to related subjects.  The hallmark of the Applied Mathematics degree is a focused four-course interdisciplinary concentration coordinated with another department or departments.  This blending of applied mathematics with another scientific discipline offers significant benefits in terms of career and graduate school choices.  The Mathematics and Applied Mathematics majors were created to offer a broad yet focused education in problem solving, analytic reasoning, critical thinking, and technical communication.  These skills will allow each major to handle the complex operational, managerial, and technical problems that routinely challenge Air and Space Force officers.  In addition, both majors provide a superior education that will facilitate success in a wide variety of graduate school programs.  Cadets majoring in Mathematics or Applied Mathematics historically perform well in areas such as operations research, physics, engineering, business administration, economics, computer science, law, medicine, meteorology, and, of course, mathematics and applied mathematics.  Flexibility is a critical component of any modern, relevant degree program. The Mathematics and Applied Mathematics majors have been designed to allow you to choose a course of study that fits your interests, while also providing an education well-suited to the modern Air and Space Forces.  As an officer with a background in math or applied math, you will be positioned to succeed across a diverse range of career fields ranging from operations research analyst or acquisitions to intelligence or pilot.  Our program’s curriculum is designed such that, by completion of our program, our graduates shall demonstrate that they have attained the following departmental Student Learning Outcomes which are intentionally aligned with the institutional outcomes: Develop strengths of character and intellect that enhance professional growth. Solve problems using sound mathematical techniques. Communicate mathematical ideas effectively in written and oral form. Explore the utility and art of mathematics.  The Mathematics and Applied Mathematics majors contribute to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS (Mathematics): 141.75 Semester Hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics Advanced Probability and Statistics Math 377 Adv STEM Option Calculus III Math 243/253 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option Differential Equations Math 245  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  22 Semester hours of required major's courses: Choose one of the following: 	 	Comp Sci 210 	Programming Fundamentals, or 	 	Comp Sci 211 	Programming for Scientists and Engineers, or 	 	Comp Sci 212 	Introduction to Programming for Analysts Math 320 	Foundations of Mathematics Math 360 	Linear Algebra Math 366 	Real Analysis Math 378 	Applied Statistical Modeling Math 465 	Modern Algebra Math 420 	Capstone I (1 sem hr) Math 421 	Capstone II (2 sem hrs)  15 Semester hours from the list of courses below to include at least one course from the Proof-Based Mathematics Courses and at least one course from the Applied Mathematics Courses. Math 346 Math 359 Math 443 Math 451 Math 467 Math 470 Ops Rsch 311 Ops Rsch 312 Ops Rsch 417 Cyber Sci 431 Econ 411 Philos 370  Engineering Math Design and Analysis of Experiments Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations Complex Variables Real Analysis II Mathematical Physics Deterministic Models Probabilistic Models Quick-Turn Analysis Cryptography Introduction to Game Theory Introduction to Symbolic Logic   Proof-Based Mathematics Courses (choose at least one of the following courses): 	Math 472 	Introduction to Number Theory 	Math 473 	Introduction to Point-Set Topology 	Math 474 	Combinatorics and Graph Theory  Applied Mathematics Courses (choose at least one of the following courses): 	Math 342 	Numerical Analysis 	Math 468 	Dynamical Systems 	Math 469 	Partial Differential Equations  6 semester hours of open electives to be coordinated with DFMS.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS (Applied Mathematics): 141.75 Semester Hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics Advanced Probability and Statistics Math 377 Adv STEM Option Calculus III Math 243/253 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option Differential Equations Math 245  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  22 Semester hours of required major's courses: 1.

There are incredible mechanical engineering systems in aerospace and automotive hardware, power generation facilities, and manufacturing.  Because systems bring together the engineering of mechanics and motion, thermodynamics and fluids, materials and structures, and control, Mechanical Engineering is a broad discipline of design and analysis.  If you aren’t sure what engineering discipline to pursue right now and you want to keep your options open, this foundational major may be perfect for you. Mechanical Engineering is also flexible, enabling focus in a variety of areas: failure analysis, aerospace structures, dynamics, or thermal-fluid systems.  If understanding, building, and utilizing state-of-the-art materials (e.g., composites and ceramics) and manufacturing processes (e.g., “3-D” printing) intrigues you, this challenging major may be right for you. The Academy Mechanical Engineering major is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.  The Vision of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, which administers the Mechanical Engineering Program, is to provide a World-Class Engineering Education for the Military Profession.  To ensure the success of our graduates, we prepare them to attain Program Educational Objectives two to five years after graduation.  These are: Recognition as successful Air or Space Force officers through demonstration of their ability to: Rapidly acquire required knowledge, Lead others effectively, Effectively apply ethical and moral standards, Improve unit performance by application of organizational skills, Make sound decisions based on critical thinking, and Communicate effectively. Selection for career training on, or ahead of, schedule, and for a progression of assignments of increasing responsibility. A demonstrated ability to solve Air and Space Force technical problems. 4) Success in continuing education.  The foundation that prepares graduates for attaining the Program Educational Objectives is provided by Student Learning Outcomes. Student Learning Outcomes describe what students must attain prior to graduation. These relate to the skills, knowledge, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program. These Student Learning Outcomes are: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics; an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors; an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences; an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts; an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives; an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions; and an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.  Incorporated within these outcomes, Mechanical Engineering majors must apply principles of engineering, basic science, and mathematics (including multivariate calculus and differential equations) to model, analyze, design, and realize physical systems, components or processes; and work professionally in both thermal and mechanical systems areas. In addition, graduates must  demonstrate design competence that includes integration of mechanical engineering topics.  A degree in Mechanical Engineering, with few exceptions, qualifies you for most every Air Force operational and support occupation.  Within engineering, you can get an assignment as a mechanical engineer, aeronautical engineer, civil engineer, astronautical engineer, or project engineer.  The Mechanical Engineering major also satisfies the educational requirements for Air Force Test Pilot, Flight Test Navigator, and Flight Test Engineer duties.  Additional specialties are Scientific Analyst and Acquisition Project Officer.  As a STEM degree, mechanical engineering provides competitive advantage for selection into U.S. Space Force and avails all Space Force career fields.  If you are a top performer in the Mechanical Engineering major, graduate school can be an option as a first Air or Space Force assignment, either through direct departmental sponsorship or by winning a prestigious national scholarship (Draper, Hertz, Rhodes, etc.).  The Mechanical Engineering major gives you the flexibility to pursue either a more specialized degree in graduate school or to continue your broad-based study in engineering. Whether you ultimately choose a  graduate program in mechanical engineering, aeronautical engineering, astronautical engineering, or materials engineering, your decision will be an informed one.  The Mechanical Engineering major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 144.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab  Chem 200  Or   Introductory Biology with Laboratory Or  Biology 215 P / C / B Option 2 General Physics II with Laboratory Physics 215 Statistics Probability and Statistics for Scientists and Engineers Math 356 Adv STEM Option Calculus III Math 243/253 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option Differential Equations Math 245  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  46 Semester hours of major's courses:  Comp Sci 206/206X 	Fundamentals of Programming for Engineers 	 	or Comp Sci 211 	Introduction to Programming for Scientists and Engineers Advanced Math Option 	Engr 346, Math 346, Math 342, or Math 344 	 	 	(See Supplemental Information 1) Mech Engr 205 	Engineering Tools Seminar Mech Engr 312 	Thermodynamics Mech Engr 320 	Dynamics Mech Engr 325 	Engineering System Dynamics Mech Engr 330 	Mechanics of Deformable Bodies Mech Engr 341 	Fluid Mechanics Mech Engr 350 	Mechanical Behavior of Materials Mech Engr 370 	Introduction to Machine Design Mech Engr 441 	Heat Transfer Mech Engr 460 	Experimental Mechanics (See Supplemental Information 2) Mech Engr 491 	Capstone Design Project I (See Supplemental Information 2) Mech Engr 492 	Capstone Design Project II (See Supplemental Information 2) Mech Engr Option I 	(See Supplemental Information 3) Mech Engr Option II 	(See Supplemental Information 3) Mech Engr Option III 	(See Supplemental Information 4)  Supplemental Information:  Engr 346 or Math 346 meets the prerequisites for all Mechanical Engineering electives listed in the Mechanical Engineering Electives Table.

Throughout history, weather has played a pivotal role in the outcome and execution of many important campaigns.  The debacle of Napoleon’s army in Russia, the scheduling of the Normandy invasion, and the destruction of Germany’s counter attack in the Battle of the Bulge, are but a few examples.  Knowledge of the weather is still important in the modern air, land, and space domains.  Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere and the weather that it generates.  At the Academy, the Meteorology major uniquely focuses on the impact of weather on military operations.  The growth of meteorology and weather forecasting is intimately linked with the emergence and rise of aviation and space power through the 20th  and into the 21st  century.  The basic properties of the atmosphere and resulting weather phenomena are literally of life-and-death importance to the Air and Space Forces.  According to Sun Tzu, “…know the ground, know the weather; your victory will then be total.”  The Meteorology major provides the knowledge and understanding necessary to analyze and predict atmospheric behavior over a broad range of time and space scales.  These phenomena include small features such as thunderstorms and tornadoes; medium-sized features such as squall lines, hurricanes and blizzards; and even larger features such as continental weather, waves in the jet stream, and climate change.  The Meteorology major requires a foundation in physics, mathematics, and an aptitude for problem solving.  This major is administered by the Department of Physics and Meteorology (DFPM).  While graduates with a Meteorology major are academically qualified for direct entry into the Weather and Environmental Sciences (WESO, 15W) career field, the majority of Meteorology graduates enter rated career fields.  The knowledge and experience gained from a better understanding of the atmosphere benefits them greatly throughout their careers.  The Meteorology Major is designed to develop officers who can: Formulate a three-dimensional picture of past and current states of the atmosphere by: gathering and interpreting in situ and remotely-sensed meteorological data from a         wide array of sources, employing conceptual models developed for different regions on varying space and         time scales, and demonstrating a thorough understanding of the physical and dynamical processes that         govern weather and climate.  Employ sound reasoning to solve the full spectrum of meteorological problems faced in military and civilian operations by: effectively relating current and forecast meteorological conditions to operational          mission and societal impacts, selecting appropriate meteorological data, algorithms, and products to answer          questions about the current state of the environment (nowcasting), and employing appropriate operational tools designed to anticipate future states of the          environment (forecasting).  Clearly communicate meteorological concepts through: written forecast discussions, forecast reviews, and/or reports, oral presentations and forecast discussions, and correct manipulation and/or coding of mathematical expressions representing the          relevant physical laws governing meteorological processes.  The Meteorology major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 140.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab Chem 200 P / C / B Option 2 General Physics II with Laboratory Physics 215 Statistics Probability and Statistics for Scientists and Engineers Math 356 Adv STEM Option Calculus III Math 243/253 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  42 Semester hours of major's courses:  Meteor 320 	Introduction to Meteorology and Aviation Weather Meteor 330 	Physical Meteorology I Meteor 331 	Physical Meteorology II Meteor 351 	Weather Data, Analysis, and Structure of Mid-latitude Weather Systems Meteor 352 	Climatology Meteor 370 	Meteorological Applications of Remote Sensing Meteor 430 	Atmospheric Dynamics I Meteor 431 	Atmospheric Dynamics II Meteor 432 	Boundary Layer Structure and Processes Meteor 450 	Tropical Meteorology Meteor 451 	Development and Evolution of Extratropical Weather Systems Meteor 452 	Mesoscale Meteorology – 14.

The Military & Strategic Studies major is an interdisciplinary program that teaches cadets how to develop and employ strategy in a military context while giving the cadet the necessary skills to succeed in any competitive environment.  Five required major’s courses provide all MSS cadets with a solid foundation in air, space, and cyber strategy in current and future conflicts, the ability to conduct scholarly research using the principles of quantitative and qualitative methods, as well as an understanding of the role of innovation in military and strategic contexts.  MSS majors then select three courses that develop the ability to employ strategy in specific military applications. In the MSS 300-level courses, cadets develop specialized understandings of unique elements of military operations and how each is implemented.  In the MSS 42X courses, cadets learn to take military capabilities and develop a strategy for operational contexts.  Designed to be an immersive and summative experience in a cadet’s last semester, the MSS 49X series brings together all of a cadet’s previous MSS courses and challenges the cadet to develop a theater campaign plan for a notional conflict in a specific region of the globe.  Finally, a major in MSS allows the cadet to purposefully develop themselves according to their own academic, military, and career interests.  Good strategists require a broad understanding of STEM, social science methods, as well as the humanities.  Breadth electives are designed to provide MSS majors the opportunity to have greater latitude in their own development as strategists, while allowing interested cadets to pursue an academic minor with minimal impact on course loads.  Through this purposeful course of instruction that covers the entire depth and breadth of the theory, context, and application of military & strategic studies, the Department of Military & Strategic Studies develops these Student Learning Outcomes and Proficiencies: Apply informed reasoning to solve a complex, contemporary military problem; Explain the structure, functions, and responsibilities of the joint force; Given a campaign plan, create a detailed supporting plan which synchronizes air, space, cyber, SOF, or surface capabilities; and Effectively communicate a scholarly argument on a Strategic Studies topic.  The Military & Strategic Studies major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  140.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  42 Semester hours of major’s courses:  	1. - 5. 15 semester hours of Foundations of Strategy (five courses):  	 MSS 298 MSS 343 MSS 444 MSS 498     and either MSS 302      or Research Methods Foundations of Joint Air, Space, and Cyber Strategy Space & Cyber Strategy for National Security Capstone Course in Joint Strategy Future Conflict and Disruptive Technologies MSS 353 Strategies of Military Innovation  6. - 8.  9 semester hours of Specialization in Employing Military Capabilities (three courses)  MSS 302 Future Conflict and Disruptive Technologies MSS 353 Strategies of Military Innovation MSS 363 ISR Analysis MSS 369 Spectrum of Conflict MSS 371 Joint Targeting and Strategy MSS 372 Wargame Design for Military & Strategic Studies MSS 377 Airpower for Combined Effects MSS 381 Air Warfare Operations and Planning Soc Sci 483 Principles of Negotiation  3 semester hours of Contextualizing Military Strategy (one course) MSS 421 	Strategy of International Power Projection 	MSS 422 	Strategy of Special Operations 	MSS 423 	Nuclear Operations and Warfighting Strategy  3 semester hours of Synthesizing National Strategy (one course) MSS 490 Strategy in Asia and the Pacific MSS 491 Strategy in the Americas MSS 493 Strategy in Eurasia 	MSS 494 	Strategy in the Middle East and Africa  - 14.  12 semester hours of MSS Breadth Electives (four courses) Any four MSS courses, or Four courses to contribute to the Geospatial Intelligence Certificate, or Four courses that contribute to a DF approved academic minor, or Four courses approved by the academic advisor   SUGGESTED COURSE SEQUENCE  Military & Strategic Studies Major /Astr Engr 310 Adv Sociocultural Opt Adv Open Option Ldrshp 400 Aero Engr 315 Ldrshp 300 	MSS Option 	3 	1 	MSS 498 	3 	1 	MSS Specialization 	3 	1 	MSS 49X 	3 	1 	Spring MSS Specialization 	3 	1 3	1 	MSS Specialization 	3 	1 3	1 	3	1 3	1 	0.75 	0 0.75 	0 	Phy Ed 	0.5 	2 	Phy Ed 	0.5 	2 	16.25 	7 	16.25 	7 Semester Hour Summary 	Core = 	93.0 Sem Hours 	Major = /	42.0 	" 	Phy Ed = 	5.0 	" Total = 140.0 " Course Unit Summary Core (29) Major (14) Phy Ed (10) MSS 251 must be taken NLT the third-class fall to declare MSS  or ForArStu - MSS   	 NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND STRATEGY MINOR  THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND STRATEGY MINOR AT A GLANCE:  The Nuclear Weapons and Strategy minor provides a pathway for cadets from all majors to build the technical and strategic foundation to lead the USAF in the second nuclear age.  Nuclear weapons play an essential role in the strategic deterrence of adversaries and the current limited nature of warfare.  The Nuclear Weapons and Strategy minor focuses on the enduring fundamentals of the nuclear enterprise.  This includes the origin of nuclear energy, strategic policy, proliferation, and the effects of radiation as a result of nuclear reactions.  The skills and abilities developed in the Nuclear Weapons and Strategy minor are of high importance to the execution of the Air Force’s nuclear mission, maintenance of the Air Force’s nuclear arsenal, and may be applied in many Air Force career fields.  Graduates who complete the Nuclear Weapons and Strategy minor will be prepared to lead the USAF in the second nuclear age and will be well prepared to support Air Force Global Strike Command, NNSA, USSTRATCOM, AFNWC, DTRA, AFTAC, and DIA.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  The Nuclear Weapons and Strategy minor requires a minimum of 146 hours and at least 2 noncore academic courses (6 semester hours) in residence in excess of the major’s requirements (including the Academy Option).  The student must complete these five courses (15 semester hours) with a grade of “C” or better.  As this is an interdisciplinary minor, no more than 3 courses for the minor can be from any one department; therefore, the option course must be from a department other than DFPM.  Required Courses:  	 	Physics 310 	Principles of Nuclear Science 	 	Physics 354 	Nuclear Weapons Engineering 	 	Physics 450 	Nuclear Weapons Effects 	 	Soc Sci 467 	Nuclear Weapons Policy and Strategy   Choose one of the following:   	 	Pol Sci 302 	American Foreign and National Security Policy 	 	MSS 423 	Nuclear Operations and Warfighting Strategy 	 	Chem 350 	Chemistry of Weapons 	 	History 320 	Winged Defense: The History of Airpower 	 	History 322 	Conquest of the New Frontier: The History of Space Power  With the approval of DFPM, DFCH, DFHI, DFMI, or DFPS, cadets may substitute a 3.0 sem hrs (or greater) 495 Special Topic or 499 Independent Study course for this requirement.  One option for the Independent Study is a summer internship at a location within the National Nuclear Enterprise, selected to provide the cadet an opportunity to work on special projects designed to give them an understanding of the dynamics and challenges within the Nuclear Enterprise.  Cadets can follow-up in the fall semester with an Independent Study that builds upon or finalizes the work done during the summer internship.  Independent Study requirements are managed and overseen by the department administering the course.  To participate in a summer internship, cadets must secure a Cadet Summer Research Program (CSRP) slot. OPERATIONS RESEARCH  THE OPERATIONS RESEARCH MAJOR AT A GLANCE:  Operations Research (OR) is the application of scientific and mathematical methods to the study and analysis of problems involving complex systems.  More simply, OR is the science of problem solving and decision making.  To gain an appreciation for the field, it is necessary to look at its origins.  OR, as a discipline, arose from the need to determine optimal resource allocation and assist decision makers during the Second World War.  Groups of mathematicians, physical scientists, and economists were assembled during the war to perform studies that would provide quantitative input for commanders.  The results of their efforts were impressive and, soon thereafter, the commercial sector realized the power of these new planning techniques.  The use of mathematics to model real world systems was nothing new; physicists and economists had been doing this for years.  What defined this new field called OR was its focus on the operations of organizations.  Not only were traditional mathematical modeling methods used, such as statistics and probability, but new modeling methods were created, such as mathematical programming and queuing theory.  This is an exciting field and one that attracts curious problem solvers who are strong in mathematics and computer science and are eager to solve real-world problems.  The description of OR provided above highlights OR’s interdisciplinary nature.  The Academy has captured the essence of the field by establishing a truly interdisciplinary major.  The OR program is jointly administered by the Departments of Computer and Cyber Sciences, Economics and Geosciences, Management, and Mathematical Sciences.  The required major’s courses include courses from each of the four departments.  Our program’s curriculum is designed such that, by completion of our program, our graduates shall demonstrate that they have attained the following Student Learning Outcomes: Apply fundamental operations research techniques to frame and solve ill-defined technical, social, political, and economic problems; Effectively form, lead, and work within multi-disciplinary teams; 3) Communicate ideas, concepts, and recommendations effectively; and  4) Learn independently.  The Operations Research major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 141.75 Semester hours  93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses to include:   Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics Advanced Probability and Statistics Math 377 Adv STEM Option Calculus III Math 243/253 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option Systems Analysis Ops Rsch 310  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  43 Semester hours of major's courses:  Comp Sci 212 	Intro to Programming for Analysts Comp Sci 362 	Computer Simulation Econ 365 	Econometrics I Econ 465 	Econometrics II Math 344 	Applied Linear Algebra Math 378 	Applied Statistical Modeling Ops Rsch 311 	Deterministic Models  Ops Rsch 312 	Probabilistic Models Ops Rsch 331 	Economic Theory and Operations Analysis Ops Rsch 421 	Capstone in Operations Research I Ops Rsch 422 	Capstone in Operations Research II Ops Rsch Option 	(See Supplemental Information) 13.

Cadets should consult with their academic advisors about choosing core class options and Operations Research electives to improve their chances of selection into specific rated or non-rated career fields. Many Operations Research majors enter the Operations Research Analyst career field (15A) and some pursue graduate school opportunities early in their careers as part of their development. Students who desire to become a 15A should maintain a major's GPA of 2.80 or higher to improve their likelihood of assignment to the career field. The Hospital Services Administrator career field (41A) has separate application and screening process that require specific coursework. 	 SUGGESTED COURSE SEQUENCE /  	 PHILOSOPHY  THE PHILOSOPHY MAJOR AT A GLANCE:  The word “philosophy” derives from a Greek work meaning the love of wisdom. In pursuit of wisdom, students of philosophy attempt to answer fundamental questions about the nature of reality, knowledge, and value.  Since antiquity, however, philosophers have reminded us that academic study alone cannot make one wise; life experience must complement the knowledge gained by study.  Further, many philosophers have insisted that wisdom as a cardinal virtue cannot exist independently of the other three cardinal virtues—courage, temperance, and justice.  The spirit of philosophy is accordingly summed up well by Plato’s Socrates.  On trial for his life and under pressure to desist from his philosophical investigations, Socrates instead proclaimed that “…for a human being the unexamined life is not worth living.” He went to his death apparently content that he had served his fellow citizens and  lived the life most worth living. Academy philosophy majors will undertake their study of philosophy as part of a life of energetic inquiry aimed at developing the virtues appropriate to a leader of character.  They will read and discuss primary texts from ancient times up to the present day.  DFPY Student Learning Outcomes:  An undergraduate program in philosophy aims to cultivate skills in the methods of philosophy and to foster learning across a broad range of philosophical topics and philosophical history.  Philosophy at the Academy includes these aims, but with adjustments.  All students are expected to defend the United States when they become part of the operational Air Force.  At the same time, the explicit aim of the institution is to build officers of character. Together, these two institutional realities set our program apart.  Our cadets should have an understanding of the ethics of war as well as the ethics of officership.  Moreover, our program should provide opportunities for further study in other topics of special interest to future officers, including philosophy of law (given the importance of the laws of war), medical ethics (given the greater possibility of encountering injured people), and religion (given the international and interreligious nature of military service).  The difference between cadets who major in philosophy and those who minor in philosophy is a matter of the degree rather than kind.  The learning objectives for both majors and minors are therefore the same.  Graduates shall demonstrate:  Skills in the methods of philosophy.  Graduates of our program will: Read critically, recognizing the assumptions, context, and arguments, made by authors; Write persuasively, following the best practices of the discipline; Argue logically, employing both informal and formal systems of logic; and Do all of this respectfully, displaying the virtues of charity, fairness, and humility.  Competence with respect to core philosophical subjects, grounded in the history of philosophy, together with special expertise in ethics as applied to the profession of arms.  Graduates of our program can: Describe a representative set of the central philosophical problems, questions, and theories, especially those associated with metaphysics, epistemology, language, ethics, and religion; Outline the general history of philosophy, with special attention to important  philosophers such as Confucius, Zuangzi, Mencius, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Avicenna, Al Gazali, Maimonides, Aquinas, Descartes, Locke, Kant, Hume, and Mill; Apply moral theory to the problems that are unique to war and the military profession; and Recognize and respond to the challenges and opportunities posed by diverse cultural and religious practices as these impact war and the military profession.  The Philosophy major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Institutional Critical Thinking Outcome.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 140.75 Semester hours  93 semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option War Stories English 411 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics courses.  42 Semester hours of major’s courses:  Philos 311 	War, Morality, and the Military Profession Philos 370 	Introduction to Symbolic Logic Philos 391/2/3/4 Philos 401/402 	Comparative Religion or Philosophy of Religion Philos 423 	Knowledge and Reality  Philos 495 	Special Topics for Philosophy majors - 13.  Philosophy Options  	(See Supplemental Information 1 and 2) 14. Open Academic Option 	Any course (≥ 3.0 sem hrs) taught under the supervision of the Dean of Faculty  Supplemental Information:   Consistent with DF’s emphasis on multiple purposeful pathways, each of these options can be filled in three ways: “Neat”:  take any 3-semester hour course taught by DFPY. “With a twist”:  take Law 463, Mgt 411, Pol Sci 301, Pol Sci 423, Pol Sci 451, and/or Econ 440; or with prior DFPY approval, take any 3-semester hour course taught by DF that focuses on “overlap” texts commonly read by another discipline as well as philosophy.  In this case, DFPY advisors will probably look for a pairing (e.g., an English 495 on American Transcendentalism with Philos 382, American Philosophy, for 6 semester hours of Philosophy Option credit). “With a splash”:  with prior DFPY approval, take any course taught by DF or academic course taught by AD (e.g., Phy Ed Aca 460) and pair it with a Philos 499 for 6 semester hours of Philosophy Option credit (e.g., Biology 459, Principles of Evolution, paired with a Philos 499 on philosophy of biology; History 352, The History of Modern America, paired with a Philos 499 on American Pragmatism).  Cadets majoring in philosophy who wish to take a foreign language minor may substitute the number of foreign language courses necessary to earn the minor, minus two courses totaling at least six semester hours, for philosophy options, one for one.  (DF-wide policy governing academic minors requires that at least two courses count only toward the minor.) Additional  foreign language courses beyond the minor can earn a similar offset with department approval. SUGGESTED COURSE SEQUENCE  Philosophy Major 	4o 	hrs 	per 	3o 	hrs 	per 	2o 	hrs 	per 	1o 	hrs 	per /History 300 Astr Engr 310 Ldrshp 400 Aero Engr 315 Math 300 Ldrshp 300 	Philos 311 	3 	1 	Philos Option 	3 	1 	Philos 495 	3 	1 	Philos Option 	3 	1 Spring Philos Option 	3 	1 	Open Academic Option 	3 	1 	3 	1 3 	1 	3 	1 3 	1 	0.75 	0 0.75 	0 	Phy Ed 	0.5 	2 	Phy Ed 	0.5 	2 	16.25 	7 	16.25 	7 Course Unit Summary Core (29) Major (14) Phy Ed (10) Semester Hour Summary 	Core = 	93.0 Sem Hours 	Major = /	42.0 	" 	Phy Ed = 	5.0 	" Total = 140.0 "  	 PHILOSOPHY MINOR  THE PHILOSOPHY MINOR AT A GLANCE:  The Philosophy minor requires five philosophy courses in addition to Philos 210.  "Philosophy" is not another discipline.  Rather, it is rational inquiry into any discipline (e.g., philosophy of psychology, philosophy of history, philosophy of law).  Philosophers seek answers to the basic, fundamental questions which underpin any field of study.  In addition to the questions addressed in the core course about how we should live our lives, philosophers also study: principles of language and reasoning (logic); foundations of empirical discovery and other ways of knowing (epistemology); and the ultimate underpinnings and structure of the self and the world (metaphysics).  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:   In addition to the successful completion of Philos 210 ("C" or better), five courses (≥ 15 semester hours) in which the student earns a grade of "C" or better. Required courses include:   One course in the history and topics series: 	 	Philos 391 	Ancient Western Philosophy   	 	Philos 392 	Western Medieval Philosophy  	 	Philos 393 	Modern Western Philosophy  	 	Philos 394 	Contemporary Topics in Philosophy  One of the following logic courses:  	Philos 200 	Introduction to Philosophy 	 	Philos 370 	Introduction to Symbolic Logic  - 4.  	Any two Philos courses.   5. Any philosophy course or one of the following courses: Econ 440, Law 463, Mgt        411, Pol Sci 301, Pol Sci 423, or Pol Sci 451.  WHY STUDY PHILOSOPHY?  Philosophy is an ancient and valuable sub district within the vast marketplace of ideas.  It is concerned with the most interesting questions in life—the questions that are fundamental and the least easy to answer or avoid. All cadets are required to take a course  in ethics, which is the discipline concerned with answering the questions: What is a good act?  What sort of person is the best person?  What is truly valuable?  By what principles should life be led?  Obviously, philosophy is not for everyone.  It is not for those who want easy answers, nor is it for those who do not care about the deeper meanings of life or the purpose of their own lives.  It is for those who wish to gain a more thorough understanding of themselves as rational, reflective beings inhabiting and working in a world that sometimes allows us to glimpse its deeper meanings. PHYSICS  THE PHYSICS MAJOR AT A GLANCE: Physics helps us to comprehend how the universe works from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies, providing fundamental insight into the laws and principles that govern everything around us. Studying physical principles allows innovation and development of new technology while improving critical thinking and problemsolving skills that are applicable across different disciplines. Modern technologies, including lasers, nuclear power, GPS, and quantum technologies are all direct applications of physics. Physics also challenges our understanding of reality: concepts such as relativity and quantum mechanics have profound implications for philosophy and our worldview.  Physics in the Air and Space Force: Majoring in physics is the only path to becoming an Air Force Physicist (Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 61D) from the Academy. U.S. Air Force Physicists work cutting edge research and development and test projects and next-generation weapon system acquisition programs under Air Force Material command, combatant commands, and other DoD stakeholders. These assignments can include experimental design and data analysis, launch of new satellites, briefing senior leaders, and fielding of state-of-the-art technologies. History also proves that the Physics major is also an excellent path to success across the whole spectrum of operational Air and Space Force career fields, to include acquisition management, space operations, weather and environmental sciences, operations research analyst, and intelligence.  Although the Physics Major has a reputation for being challenging, its rewards are evident in our majors' professional development. With the Physics Department faculty dedicated to student success and devoted to extra instruction (EI), physics students speak in conferences, publish peerreviewed articles, and receive patents. For cadets seeking to pursue an advanced academic degree while on active duty, Academy physics majors are highly competitive for graduate school due to our exceptional research program and the wide variety of scholarships and sponsorships available. After commissioning, physics major graduates serve in several leadership positions, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Department of Energy national labs and national agencies. Got your sights set even higher? Academy Physics major Dr. Ronald Sega (‘74) flew two missions on the Space Shuttle as a NASA astronaut and later went on to become the Under Secretary of the Air Force for Space, while Madison Marsh (’23) used her passion for service and physics research skills in machine learning toward early cancer detection… and became Miss America 2024.  The Physics Major Program: Academy physics majors study the theoretical foundations of all science and engineering fields: advanced mechanics, electromagnetic theory, optics and lasers, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and quantum mechanics. In addition, this knowledge is applied through computational simulation and laboratory experiments, culminating in a senior Capstone Physics Course. Each major also chooses three courses in one of the following "concentrations": Quantum Optics and Lasers, Nuclear Physics, Space Physics, and Applied Physics.   Research Centers: Beyond the classroom, physics majors can participate in a wide range of world-class scientific research and obtain academic credit through Physics Capstone Research (Physics 490) and independent studies (Physics 499) courses. DFPM hosts five research centers with more than 30 faculty and full-time researchers executing dozens of diverse projects at a given time:  The Space and Atmospheric Research Center (SPARC) designs, builds, calibrates, operates, and analyzes data from scientific payloads that fly in space; investigates the aurora and sprites in the middle atmosphere, and lightning in the lower atmosphere. The Laser and Optics Research Center (LORC) develops advanced lasers, improves optical system performance, and measures the interaction of light (photons) with matter at the quantum level. Cadets test and develop practical applications of lasers and optics, such as non-conventional imaging and beam control for directed energy weapons, photophysical characterization of nonlinear optical materials, detecting trace amounts of xenon isotopes for nuclear forensics, and working toward laser cooling and trapping of silicon for use in quantum computing. The Center for Space Situational Awareness Research (CSSAR) develops, calibrates, operates, and maintains the Academy-1-meter telescope and the worldwide Falcon Telescope Network (FTN), twelve robotic 0.5-meter telescopes around the globe from Colorado to Chile to Australia to Germany; schedules observations; analyzes satellite optical signatures in multispectral, hyperspectral, and polarization modes for space situational awareness research. - The Astronomical Research Group and Observatory (ARGO) conducts scientific discovery with the Academy one-meter telescope and the Falcon Telescope Network by gathering astronomical data on near-Earth objects, deep-space phenomena, and stellar systems. Measurement techniques encompass spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry to study celestial objects including binary stars, gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, exoplanets, and near-Earth asteroids. Finally, ARGO hosts outreach activities for Scout groups, school groups and teachers in partnership with the Planetarium. The Nuclear Enterprise Research Center (NERC) facilitates and coordinates technical research in support of the missions of various organizations within the US nuclear enterprise complex such as the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The NERC portfolio includes nuclear treaty monitoring, radiation biology, space applications, nuclear weapons effects, and nuclear power with the aim of advancing scientific knowledge and also making operation improvements for the units they support.  Learning Outcomes: Our program's curriculum is designed such that our graduates shall demonstrate that they have attained the following Student Learning Outcomes:  Physics Knowledge and Application: Demonstrate comprehensive quantitative and qualitative knowledge of the fundamental pillars of physics (classical physics, quantum theory, relativity, and thermodynamics) and apply fundamental concepts to explain or predict physical phenomena. Problem Solving Skills: Frame and solve problems competently by identifying the essential parts of a problem and formulating a strategy for solving the problem. Estimate the numerical solution to a problem, to include uncertainty analysis.

In this concentration, it is the physics major’s responsibility to have thorough discussions with their academic advisor to identify and justify a coherent three-course sequence in an area related to basic sciences and engineering. A physics major may take more than three courses if their schedule permits to delve more deeply into a subject of interest. At least two of the selected courses must be 300-level or higher and one must be a 400-level course. At most, one 3 semester hour Physics 499 cannot fulfill the 400-level course requirement if there is only one 400-level course option. All applied physics option sequences must be approved by the Physics Major AIC, the department's Director of Advanced Programs, and the Department Head. The Applied Physics Option is recommended for those seeking to double major in another major from the Basic Sciences or Engineering Divisions. Physics majors interested in the Weather and Environmental Sciences Officer (15W) career field should incorporate meteorology courses via the Applied Physics Concentration. Some illustrative possible sequences include (but are not limited to):  Aircraft Propulsion Design: Aero Engr 241/Aero Engr 361/Aero Engr 466 Atmospheric Physics: Meteor 330/Meteor 331/Meteor 430 Materials Physics: Physics 473/Mech Engr 340/Mech Engr 440 Mathematical Physics: three of Math 344/Math 451/Math 468/Math 469/Math 470 Medical Physics (pre-med)*: Chem 233/Chem 234/Chem 243/Biology 431 Space Vehicle Design: Physics 370 or Astr Engr 331/Astr Engr 436/Astr Engr 437  * Four concentration courses are required for pre-med students and should be taken by the end     of the 2° year.  Summary: While completing the U.S. Air Force Academy physics major, cadets develop a mastery of the most fundamental laws governing our universe, those same laws that dictate the radar cross section of the F-35, GPS susceptibility to jamming, and the maximum kill range of the AIM-9. Ultimately, the physics major is tailored to prepare cadets for their primary role as future officers: solving unforeseen, abstract, complex, and ill-defined problems. Regardless of AFSC or SFSC, cadets graduating from the U.S. Air Force Academy with a bachelor's degree in physics enter active duty with great confidence in their abilities to conquer the many unknowns in the nation's toughest technical challenges to maintain U.S. air, space, and cyberspace dominance for decades to come.   SUGGESTED COURSE SEQUENCE / 	 POLITICAL SCIENCE  THE POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR AT A GLANCE:  The Political Science major offers a course of studies tailored to the needs of prospective Air Force officers by providing a comprehensive understanding of both the substance and process of politics and public policy.  The major is uniquely capable of preparing cadets to comprehend the political events, both domestic and international, that will shape their careers.  It accomplishes this by examining topics such as political theory, research methods, comparative politics, international relations, American politics,  security studies, defense decision-making, political economy, and organizational behavior.  The Political Science major is flexible.  The major allows cadets to study a subfield in-depth or to examine a variety of political topics.  The wide option of electives offers an advantage for cadets who pursue a minor in a foreign language, philosophy, religion studies, or nuclear weapons and strategy.  The major offers four areas of concentration:  American politics, international relations, comparative politics and area studies, and national security policy.  Academic advisors enthusiastically assist cadets in tailoring an academic program to meet their individual interests.  Our program's curriculum is designed such that, by completion of our program, our graduates shall demonstrate that they have attained the following Student Learning Outcomes:  Explain the history, underlying theories, and operation of political systems and the American political system under the Constitution. Evaluate fundamental similarities and differences among various political systems around the world. Explain fundamental drivers of cooperation, conflict, and war in the international system. Analyze national security institutions, process, and strategy. Demonstrate proficiency in ethical, qualitative, and quantitative reasoning.  The Political Science major contributes to both the development and assessment of the Academy Critical Thinking and National Security of the American Republic Outcomes.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 140.75 Semester hours 93 Semester hours of Dean's academic core courses to include:  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutes P / C / B Option 2  Choose 1 P / C / B Option 1  Choose 1 Statistics  Choose 1 Soc Sci 311 International Security Soc Sci 212 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  5 Semester hours of Director of Athletics core courses.  42 Semester hours of major's courses:  Pol Sci 300 	Quantitative Methods and Research Design Pol Sci 301 	Political Theory  Pol Sci 302 	American Foreign and National Security Policy          (See Supplemental Information 1) Pol Sci 394 	Comparative Politics Pol Sci 491 	Capstone Seminar in Political Science: National Security and Political Analysis  - 8.

These professions support the Air Force Medical Command, which provides operational medical capability integrated within warfighting force elements. Per the USAF Surgeon General, this alignment improves the Air Force’s ability to generate medically ready forces, provide installation support to Airmen and Guardians, and partner with the Defense Health Agency to optimize health care delivery. Health professionals of the USAF provide a critical component of readiness by ensuring USAF and USSF commanders have the medical support for their warfighting capabilities. Cadets who complete this minor will meet mandatory coursework requirements necessary for application to health professions. They will also be prepared for the rigors of highly selective graduate school programs and standardized admissions tests that are required for selection as a USAF health professional.    COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  The Pre-Health Professions Minor requires 15-21 semester hours, and a minimum of 6 semester hours in excess of the major’s requirements.  The course requirements are designed to satisfy the pre-requisite requirements for most health profession graduate programs and to prepare cadets to excel as future Air Force health professionals. Each of the four tracks is designed to satisfy the pre-requisites for a specific health professions graduate program and should be carefully chosen by the cadet in consultation with their major advisor and an HPAC advisor; consult an HPAC advisor if any courses are validated. Completion of the Pre-Health Professions academic minor is NOT sufficient to compete for accession into Air Force health professions. If cadets intend to  compete for accession into health professions (medical, dental, nursing, physical therapy, physician assistant), deliberate coordination with the Academy Health Professions Advising Committee (HPAC) is required to meet all preparation and competitive release requirements. All courses must be completed with a grade of “C” or better.   PRE-MEDICAL and PRE-DENTAL TRACK  93 Semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutions P / C / B Option 1 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab Chem 200 P / C / B Option 2 General Physics II with Laboratory Physics 215 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1   21 Semester hours of minor’s courses: Bio 215        Introductory Biology with Laboratory (4) Chem 233      Organic Chemistry I (3) Chem 234      Organic Chemistry II (3) Chem 243      Organic Chemistry Laboratory (4) Bio 360       Cell and Molecular Biology (3) Bio 363       Genetics (4)  PRE-NURSING TRACK  93 Semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutions P / C / B Option 1 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab Chem 200 P / C / B Option 2 Introductory Biology with Laboratory Biology 215 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option Human Nutrition Biology 370 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1   15 Semester hours of minor’s courses: Biology 332      Microbial Diversity (3) Biology 410       Anatomy and Physiology: Sensory and Motor Integration (3) Biology 431      Microbiology (3) Biology 440      Anatomy and Physiology: Visceral Systems Integration (3) Beh Sci 440       Lifespan Development (3)  PRE-PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT TRACK  93 Semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutions P / C / B Option 1 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab Chem 200 P / C / B Option 2 Introductory Biology with Laboratory Biology 215 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option  Choose 1 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  18 Semester hours of minor’s courses: Chem 230        Introductory Organic Chemistry (3) Biology 332      Microbial Diversity (3) Biology 410       Anatomy and Physiology: Sensory and Motor Integration (3) Biology 431      Microbiology (3) Biology 440      Anatomy and Physiology: Visceral Systems Integration (3) Chem 481        Biochemistry I (3)  PRE-PHYSICAL THERAPY TRACK  93 Semester hours of Dean’s academic core courses.  Core Requirement Required Core Options / Substitutions P / C / B Option 1 General Chemistry II Lecture and Lab Chem 200 P / C / B Option 2 General Physics II with Laboratory Physics 215 Statistics  Choose 1 Adv STEM Option  Choose 1 Adv Sociocultural Option Sociology Beh Sci 360 Adv Open Option  Choose 1  16 Semester hours of minor’s courses: Biology 215       Introductory Biology with Laboratory (4) Biology 320      Biomechanics (3) (Offered Spring, even numbered years only) Biology 410       Anatomy and Physiology: Sensory and Motor Integration (3) Biology 440      Anatomy and Physiology: Visceral Systems Integration (3) Beh Sci 440       Lifespan Development (3)                     QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES MINOR  QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES MINOR AT A GLANCE: Our world is at a critical juncture in history in which a new field of engineering is rapidly developing based on quantum information science. Quantum technology has already changed the world through quantum timing, the underlying technology in the Global Positioning System, and is set to revolutionize it at least three more times through quantum sensing, quantum networking, and quantum computing. The Quantum Technologies minor develops cadets into quantum-proficient officers by covering the foundational principles of the field using simple physical models, many of which are sufficient to understand the core principles of leading quantum computing architectures and algorithms, field-tested quantum sensors, and advanced timing systems, without the need to study quantum physics for several years. Graduates of the minor will have the quantum background needed to lead future quantum technology research, development, and acquisition programs, work comfortably on the boundary between quantum engineering and other engineering disciplines, and think strategically about how to employ quantum technology. This minor answers the national mandate to build a quantum-proficient workforce and officer corps, helping ensure the USAF and DOD maintain a technology lead over other nations in great power competition.   Cadets completing the course sequence for a Quantum Technologies Minor will: Build a sufficient understanding of quantum information, science, and technology to enable future leadership in quantum technology research, development, engineering, or acquisition programs, and to make informed policy and fiscal decisions regarding quantum technologies. Understand quantum technology basic engineering principles, applications, & use cases in quantum timing, sensing, networking, and computing. Think strategically about how to employ quantum technologies.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  The Quantum Technology Minor requires a minimum of 15-semester hours, six of which must be taken in-residence and count exclusively towards this minor (they may not be counted toward another major or minor). Students must complete these five courses with a grade of “C” or better. As an interdisciplinary minor, no more than three courses for the minor can be from any one department. To achieve the core learning outcomes stated above, the following three courses are required: Physics 242      Foundations of Quantum Technology Comp Sci 314    Quantum Computing Physics 314      Applications of Quantum Technology Two additional courses will allow cadets to develop sufficient breadth by studying how quantum technologies relate to their area of study. These tracks, and their associated learning objectives and courses are listed below. Some courses have non-core prerequisites.  FOUNDATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS CONCENTRATION The Foundations Concentration develops an understanding of the scientific, and philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics, to include the historical development, relation to nuclear and materials engineering, and how quantum mechanics has impacted the philosophy of science.  Concentration Courses:  Physics 264    Modern Physics (or Physics 465 Quantum Mechanics) Philos 330     Introduction to the Philosophy of Science  CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS CONCENTRATION:  The Chemistry and Materials Concentration develops a deeper understanding of physical systems for which efficient quantum simulations have had/will have the largest impacts, to include chemistry, atomic & molecular dynamics, materials science, spectroscopy, and protein Interactions.  Concentration Courses (Choose Two):  Chem 335       Physical Chemistry I Chem 336       Physical Chemistry II Mech Engr 340   Introduction to Material Science for Engineers  CYBER CONCENTRATION:  The Cyber Concentration develops a deeper understanding of those areas in the cyber domain which quantum computing has impacted/will impact, to include cryptography and artificial intelligence. Cadets in this concentration will choose two courses, one from each of the following lists:  Concentration Courses: Take: 	Comp Sci 210  	Programming Fundamentals (or Comp Sci 211: Introduction to Programming for Scientists & Engineers or Comp Sci 212: Introduction to Programming for Analysts) and choose one: Comp Sci 471    Artificial Intelligence Cyber Sci 431    Cryptography  ENGINEERING AND ANALYSIS CONCENTRATION:  The Engineering and Analysis Concentration develops a deeper understanding of those areas in engineering which will accelerate the development of quantum technologies, and those areas which quantum technologies have had/will have the largest impacts to include global positioning, secure communications, and materials development. Concentration Courses (Choose Two):  Astr Engr 332      Satellite Communications ECE 281         Digital Design and Computer Architecture ECE 343         Electromagnetics Mech Engr 340     Introduction to Material Science for Engineers 	Physics 291  	 Introduction to Optics & Lasers (or Physics 264 Modern Physics or Physics 465 Quantum Mechanics) Math 344         Applied Linear Algebra (or Math 360 Linear Algebra) 	Math 346  	 Engineering Math (or Engr 346: Engineering Math with Applications, or Math 469: Partial Differential Equations, or Math 245: Differential Equations or ECE 245: Differential Equations with Circuit Applications)  STRATEGIC IMPACT CONCENTRATION:  The Strategic Impact Concentration enables cadets to think more strategically about employing quantum technologies, the impacts they have had on war, the effects they may have on future warfare, and how to make national security decisions related to quantum technologies.  Concentration Courses:  MSS 302        Future Conflict and Disruptive Technologies Pol Sci 466       Cyber Security Policy and Politics  ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCENTRATION:  The Ethical and Legal Considerations Concentration will have cadets consider the broad ethical and legal considerations concerning quantum technologies and their impacts on societies.  Concentration Courses:  Philos 320      Ethics and Technology Law 442        Law and Emerging Technology  COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS: Cadets may request to substitute up to one course in the concentrations listed above, if that course meets significant educational outcomes of the Quantum Technologies minor and is at least 3.0 credit hours. This includes a course from another track, a 495 Special Topic, Senior Capstone Research, or a 499 Independent Study course. To request a course substitute, advisors must submit an Academic Waiver Request to the Director of the Quantum Technology Minor (who resides within the Department of Physics and Meteorology), which will include a description of the Educational Outcomes that are met and assessed by the course, and a copy of the course syllabus if the course is not within another track. RELIGION STUDIES MINOR  THE RELIGION STUDIES MINOR AT A GLANCE:  This minor provides cadets the knowledge and skills they need to serve and lead effectively in other parts of the world as they engage persons of different cultures and religions, both in times of peace and in times of war. A central goal of the academic study of religion at the Academy is increasing cadets' religious literacy, i.e., their understanding of different world religions, and how religion, as variously conceived and practiced, decisively informs the way people across the globe view themselves, the world, and their place within the world. Furthermore, it is by studying religion that cadets become better able to relate to and work with those who possess religious worldviews, and lead religious lives, that differ from their own. The study of religion therefore provides cadets the knowledge and skills they need to serve and lead effectively in a pluralistically religious (and non-religious) military, as well as a better understanding of the cultural background in expeditionary settings.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  Cadets will earn the minor by completing five courses (15 semester hours):  Three required courses (nine semester hours) that provide a basic understanding of the concept of religion and of faith traditions around the world:  Philos 401 	Comparative Religion (or another course approved by Humanities and Social Science Division Chairs) Philos 402 	Philosophy of Religion (or another course approved by Humanities and Social Science Division Chairs) 	Philos 420 	Religion Studies Capstone (to be completed last)  Two elective courses (six semester hours) that broaden students' understanding of religion in the context of their academic majors.  Courses offered in the current curriculum will count if the owning department head, Humanities Division Chair, and Social Sciences Division Chair concur that they offer substantial insight into the nature and practice of religion:  Behavioral Science  sociology, personality, social psychology, biopsychology-depending on section and syllabus English 	literature courses, depending on the syllabus in a given semester History  	any course might count depending on the syllabus that semester: 	History 220 	Let Freedom Ring?: American History since Reconstruction 	History 230 	Bastille to Brexit: Introduction to Modern European History 	History 240 	Steppes, Stalin, and Sputnik: Introduction to Russia and Eurasia 	History 250 	Introduction to the History of the Middle East and North Africa History 260 	Historia Pasada y Presente: Introduction to Modern Latin American History 	History 270 	Modern East Asian History History 280 History 290 History 360 History 361 History 368 Hum 430 Hum 461 Hum 463 Law 351 Law 360 Mgt 440 Philos 350 Philos 365  Africa South of the Sahara Global Contact and Local Responses in South and Southeast Asia Topics in Regional History:  Eastern/Western Europe; Russia; Latin America Topics in Regional History: Eastern, Central, or Western Asia; Africa Big Ideas: Intellectual Trends in World History The Holocaust Russian Literature Far Eastern Literature U.S. Constitutional Law Law and Literature Managerial Lessons in Literature Philosophy and Christian Thought  C.S.

Up until now, robotics have primarily served in roles where repetitive functions could be automated.  However, as cost, computing power and algorithmic development simultaneously enable newer classes of low-cost attritable assets, robotic systems are taking a prominent role in defense and projection of power.  The Robotics and Autonomous Systems Minor is for those cadets who want to go beyond the basic understanding of technology in the DoD via the Academy Core, and will focus explicitly on capability, need and employment of robotic systems.  It provides cadets exposure to tactical, operational, strategic considerations as well as technological capabilities and limits of robotic systems.  It adds to the core curriculum’s foundation with greater depth in the specific application of robotic systems relevant to any Air Force operational specialty. This minor is compatible with any academic major.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS MINOR:    The Robotics and Autonomous Systems Minor requires a minimum of 15 semester hours. The student must complete these five courses (15 semester hours) with a grade of “C” or better. Up to 9 semester hours may “multiple count” (double, triple, etc., as the case may be) toward this minor and a cadet’s advanced core options and/or major’s requirements. In the event that more than 9 semester hours satisfy requirements for this minor and a cadet’s major, second minor, or core classes, additional courses must be taken from the list of courses below. A cadet must take a minimum of 6 semester hours solely counted for the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Minor. This is an interdisciplinary minor.

Acting responsibly in an ever-changing world of ill-defined problems requires critical thinking.  At the Academy, critical thinking is defined as: the process of self-aware, informed, and reflective reasoning for problemsolving and decision-making even in the absence of ideal conditions.  Cadets’ critical thinking is developed in an intentional manner across the Academy experience, promoting the use of appropriate critical thinking processes within a discipline or context.  ACADEMY GRADUATES WILL BE ABLE TO:  Self-aware Reasoning  Proficiency 1: Describe their own assumptions and contexts.  Proficiency 2: Explain how their own assumptions and contexts influence approaches to problem solving and decision making.  Informed Reasoning  Proficiency 3: Identify relevant information that is needed to solve a problem or make an effective decision.  Reflective Reasoning  Proficiency 4: Identify the assumptions and contexts that underlie an argument.  Proficiency 5: Evaluate the strength of an argument in support of an idea or interpretation.  Proficiency 6: Propose alternative interpretations of information or observations.  Problem-solving and Decision Making  Proficiency 7: Identify issue(s) in need of solving.  Proficiency 8: Intentionally apply an appropriate process to develop solutions to an issue.  Proficiency 9: Assess the merit of multiple options in order to identify the best solution.  Proficiency 10: Explain how changes to assumptions or contexts alter the recommended solution. ____________________________ CLEAR COMMUNICATION  Outcome Team Leads:  Dr. Michael Fowler (DFMI)  Clear communication is a multi-faceted, nuanced and teachable practice essential for successful officers and leaders of character. Officers must effectively convey information through communication acts, which may include staff correspondence, operational orders, strategic documents and civilian and military stakeholder briefings. Clear communication signifies the professional competence and knowledge expected in a leader while engendering the trust of others. At USAFA, cadets are commonly taught and assessed on written and oral forms of communication. Written communication ranges from short, less formal communication acts on digital media to lengthy, scholarly works. Oral communication ranges from talking to small groups to large public audiences and includes visual aids, vocal dynamics and body language. USAFA develops cadets’ communication skills, experience, and confidence in four areas. First, clear communication begins by analyzing the communication situation, where planning takes place prior to the communicative act. Second, content is developed in a compelling way appropriate with the context. Third, content delivery is enhanced through inclusion of professional conventions. Fourth, revision and clarification ensures the communication act meets the communication objectives. USAFA strives to develop cadets who will successfully employ clear communication skills throughout their Air Force and Space Force careers.  ACADEMY GRADUATES WILL BE ABLE TO1:  Analyze the Communication Situation (Includes the Air Force CELOs listed under sub-competency A2.6.4:  Strategic Communication)  Proficiency 1: Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the rhetorical situation for a communication task.  Proficiency 2: Defines the means, method, and format required to effectively complete a communication task.  Build Content/Tell Compelling Stories  Proficiency 3: Articulate a compelling, authoritative, and precisely stated central message that is responsive to the communication situation.  Proficiency 4: Exhibit skillful and ethical use of credible, relevant sources to develop ideas that are appropriate for the discipline and communication mode.  Employ Professional Conventions for Language, Syntax, and Mechanics  Proficiency 5: Apply contextually and disciplinary appropriate stylistic conventions and terminology.  Proficiency 6: Incorporate effective delivery techniques to make a compelling communicative act.  Engage in Revision and Clarification Processes  Proficiency 7: Participate in feedback processes in ways that lead to improved communication.  	 APPLICATION OF ENGINEERING PROBLEM-SOLVING METHODS  Outcome Team Lead: Lt Col Daniel Showalter (DFAS)  Graduating cadets will recognize the engineering and technical challenges of the Air Force mission and the physical capabilities and limits within their assigned career fields and weapon systems.  These officers need to not only be "operators," but to become problem solvers that use engineering principles to devise enhanced capabilities essential to achieving and maintaining Air Force dominance in air, space, and cyberspace.  Proficiencies are organized into two broad categories: Fundamental Domain Knowledge (i.e., knowledge of basic engineering principles across a variety of physical domains relevant to Department of the Air Force missions in air, space, and cyberspace, and the infrastructure within which they operate). Problem Solving Process (i.e., using a top-down, systematic problem solving method, shown via italicized steps, to address the kind of ill-defined problems they will encounter across domains in their USAF careers).  ACADEMY GRADUATES WILL BE ABLE TO:  Fundamental Domain Knowledge  Proficiency 1: Describe and apply the principles governing the performance and capabilities of aerospace vehicles and cyber systems, and their possible effects.  Proficiency 2: Describe and apply principles governing the performance, capabilities, and defense of USAF's and USSF’s critical communication, sensing, control, and physical infrastructure.  Problem Solving Process  Proficiency 3: Formulate a problem definition from an incongruous set of requirements and constraints.  Proficiency 4: Create a viable design using robust and accepted engineering principles.  Proficiency 5: Apply decision-making skills to help lead to problem resolution and objectively determine a design solution from a set of design solutions which best meets a given set of requirements.  Proficiency 6: Develop physical and/or virtual systems using engineering tools which are tested to evaluate candidate designs, then apply the results back into the design process to develop improved design solutions, inform the decision-making process, and improve the final product. Proficiency 7: After solving a problem, cadets will reflect to comprehend systematic problem solving processes and the relationship to continuous process improvement.  (Includes Air Force CELO A2.7.2.1.2 listed under sub-competency A2.7.2:  Decision Making).  	 SCIENTIFIC REASONING AND THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE  Outcome Team Lead: Dr. Joe Eichholz (DFMS)   Science, at its essence, is a process of discovery relying on testable ideas to produce explanations of the natural world.  This process, grounded in the Nature of Science and Scientific Reasoning, has resulted in fundamental Scientific Principles allowing us to explain natural phenomena and make informed decisions.  Scientific explanations, in turn, often rely on mathematics as the language that describes the natural world.  The Air Force needs science-proficient officers who can make decisions in a world increasingly influenced by scientific and quantitative data.  Therefore, the goal of this outcome is to develop science-proficient officers, officers who exercise scientific habits of mind1. This means cadets will  be capable in the concepts, practices, and evaluation of the natural and mathematical sciences.  Or, put simply, know, do, and apply.  The three proficiencies listed below provide the basis for teaching and assessing the goal.  The bullets provide a description of the kinds of performance expected to display that proficiency.  The descriptions, framed as actions, are intended to convey the idea that the scientifically literate person both understands and is capable of undertaking a basic set of practices2.  These proficiencies are not discipline specific but are instead integral themes that apply across the natural and mathematical sciences.  Repeated exposure is necessary to develop scienceproficient and quantitatively literate officers.  Therefore, cadets must encounter these proficiencies across multiple disciplines, such as biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics.  ACADEMY GRADUATES WILL BE ABLE TO:  Proficiency 1: Demonstrate understanding of the basic principles, concepts, and language in the natural and mathematical sciences.  Foundational knowledge and skill in the scientific disciplines is crucial in developing a scientifically literate individual.  Summarized generally, a scientifically literate individual understands the basic concepts and mathematical tools of the scientific disciplines.  Built upon this foundation is the ability to approach and solve problems from a scientific mindset and the ability to assess scientific information pertinent to decision making.  Cadets can demonstrate this proficiency by the following Recall and apply appropriate scientific knowledge Identify and use explanatory models Make and justify appropriate predictions  Proficiency 2: Apply the methods and practices of the natural and mathematical sciences.  No matter what career path is chosen, the study of science will enrich critical thinking skills and expand appreciation of the natural world.  Summarized generally, a scientifically literate individual understands how science works.  More specifically, a scientifically literate individual knows how to ask scientific questions, how to collect and evaluate empirical data, how to identify patterns in those data, how to access and read relevant primary research, and how to determine the strengths and limitations of different methodologies.  Cadets can demonstrate this proficiency by the following Plan and carry out discovery-based investigations Identify assumptions and propose methods to explore a question scientifically Record observations and collect data Analyze and interpret data Generate tables and graphics to convey data Construct explanations of findings based on principles and evidence   Proficiency 3: Apply scientific habits of mind to access and evaluate scientific information that is pertinent to decision-making.  Leadership requires continuous decision-making.  It is essential that Air Force officers recognize questions for which scientific information is relevant and that they have the skills to access and evaluate scientific information.  Leaders should recognize that science is an ongoing process that results in reliable knowledge that is nonetheless subject to change.  Cadets can demonstrate this proficiency by the following Describe science as an ongoing intellectual pursuit of knowledge that is subject to change Identify the types of questions that science can address Acquire scientific information from published literature that is relevant to a subject or a question Distinguish between sound scientific work and flawed science or pseudoscience  ____________________________ 1http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/think_science 2http://www.oecd.org/pisa/test/PISA2015-Released-FT-Cognitive-Items.pdf   	 ETHICS AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY  Outcome Team Lead: Dr. Paul Macdonald (DFPY)  When deciding how to act, Air Force leaders of character comprehend moral knowledge and ethical alternatives, respect the dignity of all affected persons, use ethical judgment in moral decision making as leaders to select the best alternative, and act consistently with that judgment so as to develop habits of moral excellence. Moral knowledge, respect for human dignity, sound ethical judgment, and virtuous habits of character all crucially contribute to the central leadership practices of living honorably, lifting others, and elevating performance.   ACADEMY GRADUATES WILL BE ABLE TO:  Moral Knowledge  Proficiency 1: Explain the main theoretical approaches to normative ethics.  Proficiency 2: Explain how social science facts and theories relate to the cultivation of moral character and describe how one’s own background, habits, values, and assumptions may affect one’s moral views and behaviors.   Proficiency 3: Defend the existence of moral knowledge against challenges.  Proficiency 4: Uphold the existence of the ethical and legal foundations of the USAF mission.  Respect for Human Dignity   Proficiency 5: Demonstrate professional behaviors and attitudes with others, including fair and equitable treatment of others and consideration of another person’s basic human rights.  Proficiency 6: Understand the perspectives of others.  Proficiency 7: Recognize and respond appropriately to violations of human dignity, especially degrading and humiliating treatment.  Proficiency 8: Leverage the value of differences in perspectives, approaches, preferences, race, gender, background, religion, experience, generation, thought, and other factors for mission accomplishment and foster an environment of inclusion. (Includes the Airman’s Foundational Competency of “Fosters Inclusion” as detailed in Table A5.5 of the Air Force Handbook 36-2647.)    Moral Decision Making  Proficiency 9: Act in accord with procedures that integrate ethical theory, psychological and sociological facts, and principles of the profession of arms as part of a transparent process for deliberation and decision-making that includes careful analysis of the consequences of one’s actions.  Habits of Moral Excellence  Proficiency 10: Develop trust and commitment by promoting Air Force core values (integrity first, service before self, excellence in all we do) through goals, words, and actions. (Includes the Airman’s Foundational Competencies of “Accountability,” “Perseverance,” “Initiative,” and “Service Mindset” as detailed, respectively, in Tables A4.1, A 4.2, A4.8, and A5.3 of the Air Force Handbook 36-2647.)  Table A5.5.

To foster their success in these interactions, the Academy has created a three-phased approach to help cadets better understand the human condition, cultures, and societies.  The first phase has to do with knowing oneself in order to live honorably, where cadets are required to examine their own identity as human beings, citizens in a republic, and officerstatesmen in the United States Air Force.  The second phase has to do with knowing others to lift others, where cadets begin to examine the identity of others and to include those from cultures and societies different from their own. These first two phases are necessary to accomplish the third phase, which involves constructive engagement with others in order to elevate performance. Being able to prudently interact with individuals from different milieus resides at the heart of intercultural or cross-cultural competence and includes both domestic and international environments.   ACADEMY GRADUATES WILL BE ABLE T0:  Know Oneself to Live Honorably   Proficiency 1:  Describe key elements of their own identity as human beings, citizens of a republic, and officer-statesmen.  Proficiency 2: Explain historical, cultural, societal, and political developments that have shaped their own identity and worldview.  Know Others to Lift Others  Proficiency 3: Describe key elements of an identity different from one's own.  Proficiency 4: Explain historical, cultural, social, and political developments that have shaped another's identity and worldview.  Elevate Performance through Constructive Engagement  Proficiency 5: Explain the uniqueness, differences, and interconnections of various peoples, cultures, and societies.  Proficiency 6: Respond in culturally competent ways to various cultural and social scenarios, settings, and situations. NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC IN A COMPLEX GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT  Outcome Team Lead: Dr. Paul Bezerra (DFMI)  National Security refers to protecting and advancing a society’s fundamental interests. Regardless of academic major, USAFA graduates must understand the fundamental interests of the U.S., the methods and tools available to the U.S. for furthering those interests, and both the domestic and international constraints the U.S. faces in doing so. Indeed, USAFA graduates appreciate and navigate the multifaceted and complex nature of national security and the inherent challenges of developing and implementing U.S. national security policy.   ACADEMY GRADUATES WILL BE ABLE TO:  Constitutional Foundations of National Security in the American Republic  Proficiency 1: Compare and contrast the U.S. Constitution’s impact on domestic and foreign policy.   Proficiency 2: Explain and asses the effects of civilian leadership controlling the military in the U.S.   Developing U.S. National Security Policy in a Complex Global Environment  Proficiency 3: Differentiate relevant institutions and actors within the U.S. national security apparatus.   Proficiency 4: Explain the relationship between the international environment’s structure, and the values and interests of the U.S. and others.   Proficiency 5: Explain the evolution of U.S. military strategy, and economic and foreign policy in grand strategy.   Implementing U.S. National Security Strategy  Proficiency 6: Design and defend a plan to achieve national security objectives using appropriate forms and instruments of power.   Proficiency 7: Design and defend a plan to achieve military objectives through force consistent with relevant military theory.  WARRIOR ETHOS AS AIRMEN AND GUARDIANS  Outcome Team Lead: Dr. Justin Stoddard (CCLD) and Lt Col Nick Reynolds (CWXX)  Warrior ethos is the embodiment of the warrior spirit: tough-mindedness, tireless motivation, an unceasing vigilance, a commitment to be the world’s premier air, space, and cyberspace force, and if necessary, a willingness to sacrifice one’s life for the defense of the Nation. USAF and USSF warfighters exemplify warrior ethos by examining the profession of arms and the nature of war through many perspectives and cultural dynamics. Armed with this knowledge, warfighters demonstrate warrior ethos through self-discipline in their personal and professional lives as they exemplify the core values and AF standards. They further exemplify the moral character and courage it takes to do the right thing in the face of adversity, even at an increased risk to themselves or the mission. Finally, warfighters exemplify warrior ethos by developing their resiliency through repetition and practice, while also employing the durable mindset necessary to keep moving forward and apply lessons learned despite significant challenges, mental and physical hardships, and even failure. The warrior ethos proficiencies that follow comprise a process of the intellectual development inherent to every warfighter on their journey to becoming a Leader of Character.  ACADEMY GRADUATES WILL BE ABLE TO:  Understand the Profession of Arms.  Proficiency 1:  Critically examine and demonstrate comprehension of the military profession of arms and the nature of war through multiple perspectives (AFH36-2647 Table A2.1, 1.5 – Information Seeking; AF724-A I.1– Job Proficiency).  Exemplify Discipline  Proficiency 2: Exhibit reliable, responsible, orderly composure while under stress that conforms to professional AF standards (AFH36-2647 Table A2.1, 1.1 – Accountability, 1.9 – Self-Control; AF724-A III.2 – Accountability).  Demonstrate Moral Character  Proficiency 3: Demonstrate and apply the USAF core values in a variety of contexts, personifying honesty and integrity, living honorably, lifting others, elevating performance, and doing the right thing in service to others and the unit (AFH36-2647 Table A2.1, 2.3 – Service Mindset, 2.5 – Fosters Inclusion; AF724-A II.1 – Inclusion and Teamwork; USAFAMAN 36-3526, 2.2 – A Leader of Character).     Demonstrate Courage  Proficiency 4: Initiate and complete well-informed, appropriate actions to influence mission completion even at an increase to personal risk or risk of failure (AFH36-2647 Table A2.1, 1.4 – Decision Making, 1.8 – Initiative; AF724-A I.2 – Initiative).  Exhibit Resiliency  Proficiency 5: Work tirelessly toward long-term challenges, analyzing and applying creative strategies to adapt to changing conditions and increase physical, mental, and professional performance despite adversity, hardships, or failure (AFH36-2647 Table A2.1, 1.2 – Perseverance, 1.7 – Resilience, 3.3 – Creative Thinking; AF724-A I.2 – Adaptability, IV.2 – Innovation).  CURRICULUM MAP  Proficiencies / 1 2 3 4 5 History 100 X     MSS 251 X X X  X PE 110  X X  X PE 111  X X X X PE 112  X X X X PE 119  X X X X PE 211  X X X X PE 215  X X X X PE 222  X X X X PE 315  X X X X BCT X X X X X Commissioning Education X   X   CW req’d training (HRE, ECDT, etc.)   X X  CST X X X X X CULEX  X X X X NCLS X                   X = denotes courses where proficiencies will be assessed  Note: The assessment strategy over the next few years will focus primarily on the courses and experiences shown above.

USAFA provides an immersive developmental experience preparing cadets to succeed amidst challenges of the 21st  century. Over 47 months, cadets participate in education, training, and experiences found in the Leader of Character Framework and Core Values to bring to life the roles and responsibilities they will face on active duty.

The program targets community service activities, and helps cadets develop their leadership and organizational abilities while enhancing their sense of responsibility to others and giving of their free time to meet community needs.  Cadet Service Learning continually seeks out service opportunities both in the local community and on a national scale as well; examples include:  Habitat for Humanity and significant relief and service efforts like Hurricane Katrina. Cadet Service Learning is a catalyst for cadet development and growth in  key leadership areas designed to create officers of character for the nation.  Lessons of Living Honorably in the Profession of Arms (Honor Education).  Cadets acquire an awareness of the foundational concepts of living honorably in the profession of arms during Basic Cadet Training, and thereafter continually expand their awareness and internalization of virtues that support living honorably throughout their four years at the Academy.  The education plan begins with the Introduction to Living Honorably in the Profession of Arms (ILHPA) instructional series during Basic Cadet Training (BCT).  Living honorably in the profession of arms is a series of Lessons and small group sessions aimed at developing the highest standards of personal integrity and strength of character in each cadet, in preparation for commissioning and to serve as a moral basis throughout his or her officer career.  During BCT and the academic year the Cadet Wing and Cadet Wing Character & Honor Representatives train, manage, administer, and teach the Lessons.  Ultimately the goal is the internalization of habits of living honorably in order to produce a leader of character.  National Character and Leadership Symposium (NCLS).  Attended by 4,000 cadets; 1,000+ Academy faculty and staff; and 1,000+ guests, students, and faculty from military academies and universities across the nation and around the world. This nationally recognized forum ties together distinguished scholars, military leaders, and corporate executives with a popular student consortium to explore character and leadership issues. Past keynote lectures have been given by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of the Air Force, Olympic gold medalists, military personnel from all services, and influential thought leaders – including the legendary Coach John Wooden of UCLA, Dr. Brené Brown, and Simon Sinek. NCLS provides our cadets and permanent party the opportunity to enhance their understanding of character-based leadership.   CHEMISTRY (Chem) Offered by the Department of Chemistry (DFCH)  Chem 100.

Whenever possible, ESL cadets will take EAP 109 their first semester, English 111 their second semester, and English 211 their third semester. Math 130.  Math 130 is a three-semester hour pre-calculus math course.  Cadets may be placed into Math 130 based on results of math placement testing.  These cadets will take Math 130 their first semester, Math 141 their second semester, and Math 142 their third semester.  CORE SUBSTITUTE:  If an academic department requires cadets in its major to take a tailored version of a core course, or a core course earlier than one year removed from its designation (e.g., 400-level core courses expected to be taken in the 1° year), that version of the course will be identified as a core substitute and be given a different (appropriate) number.  Example:  Soc Sci 311 is a core course for all 2° cadets.  Pol Sci and For Ar Stu majors will normally take that course as 3° cadets enrolled in the core substitute course labeled Soc Sci 212.  These different versions of a core course require different course descriptions in the Curriculum Handbook because the two versions have different known prior learning experiences and prerequisites and therefore different developmental expectations and approaches to the course. A major requiring cadets to take a core  course no more than one year away from its core year has the option to create a new core substitute for their majors. Additionally, specialized versions of core courses are required for some majors  (e.g., core substitute Math 356 for core Math 300) or available with department approval for interested cadets (e.g., core substitute English 212 for core English 211).  CO-REQUISITE: Course may be taken earlier or at the same time with, but no later than, another.  COURSE: A body of instruction in the the Academy curriculum.  Courses may be academic or non-academic, graded or non-graded, core or major, advanced, audited, repeat, continuing, substitute or overload.  DELAYED COURSE: A core course taken in a later semester than found in the normal sequence for the particular class.  Authorization to delay a core course must be approved by the appropriate department head.  Delayed courses must be taken in the semester approved by the department head (see Section 2-6, Core Sequences).  DISCIPLINARY MAJOR: A major with a specific area of concentration which requires at least 42 semester hours beyond the core.  Refer to Section 2-8 for requirements of offered majors.  ELECTIVE COURSE:  Any course a cadet elects to take beyond the mandatory core curriculum.  FINAL EXAMINATION: An evaluation covering an entire course.  It requires two or more hours to complete and counts for at least 25% of the course grade.  See the course description portion of this handbook to find out which courses require a final examination. Unless waived by the Vice Dean for Academics, courses listing a final examination must have an in-class examination during the final examination periods. Final examinations are scheduled by course, not by section.  NOTE: Cadets who resign at the end of semester will receive course credit only if all finals/final projects are completed.  FINAL PROJECT: A project covering an entire course and counting for a significant percentage of the course grade.  See the course description portion of this handbook to find out which courses require a final project.  Unless waived by the Vice Dean for Academics, final projects must be turned in no later than the last day of regularly scheduled classes.  Final projects will not be scheduled for turn-in during the final examination period.  NOTE: Cadets who resign at the end of semester will receive course credit only if all finals/final projects are completed. GRADED COURSE: A course for which a grade of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C- or D is awarded upon successful completion.  Grades of F (failing), W (withdrawn), WP (withdrawn passing), WF (withdrawn failing), and I (incomplete) may also be awarded at the end of a graded course.  GRADED REVIEW (GR): An evaluation covering material taught during several periods of instruction.  It carries weight equal to two or more quizzes.  The extent of the material and the approximate weight assigned to each GR are announced before the examination. If cadets are scheduled for more than two GRs on the same day, they may complete the additional GR(s) during free periods on the opposite day of the same Lesson number with appropriate department head approval.  A common graded review is a GR administered to an entire course of cadets at one time, during the common use period from 0630-0723. See the Academy Instruction 36-3524, Cadet Graded Reviews and Course Evaluations.  GRADUATION (ON TIME): Graduating in eight (8) semesters with the cadet's incoming class.  This graduation ceremony occurs in May/June of each year.  Cadets must graduate on time, even if it means dropping their major from disciplinary to a divisional major or the Bachelor of Science Program.  Only the Academy Board may make a cadet a late graduate (see Late Graduation for further explanation).  LATE GRADUATION: Graduating after the May/June ceremony held for the cadet's incoming class. Only the Academy Board and Superintendent may make a cadet a late graduate.  MAJOR'S COURSE: A course taken to satisfy the requirements for an academic major.  NON-GRADED COURSE: A course with no final grade assigned. Successful course completion is indicated by enrollment in the course. If a cadet does not successfully complete the course, the cadet is withdrawn from the course.    NORMAL COURSE LOAD:  The number of semester hours of academic courses and/or nonacademic courses which a cadet may take without regard to grade point average.  OVERLOAD: Overloads are courses taken in excess of the normal course load.  Cadets fulfilling overload requirements may take an overload after their first year at the Academy.  PASS-FAIL COURSE: A course for which a grade of P (passing) is awarded upon successful completion.  Grades of F (failing), W (withdrawn), WP (withdrawn passing), WF (withdrawn failing), and I (incomplete) may also be awarded at the termination of a non-graded course.    PREREQUISITE: A course which serves as a foundation for another course and is therefore required to be taken in an earlier semester.  QUALITY POINTS: Quality points are numerical values, based on a 4.0 grading scale, that directly correspond to the letter grade a cadet receives for a course (excluding special grades) and that standardize performance values for courses of varying semester hour credits, all of which are used in the calculation of a cadet’s Grade Performance Average (GPA).  Course Quality Points are quality points multiplied by the semester hour value of the course.  QUIZ: An evaluation which covers material taught in a small unit of instruction. Normally, it requires less than half of one class period to complete.  Quizzes may be one of two types:  (1) departmental quizzes, designed by a committee or the course director and administered to all cadets meeting the course on the same day, or (2) instructor quizzes, designed by the individual instructor and administered at the instructor's discretion during any class meeting not scheduled for a departmental quiz or graded review.  REPEATABLE COURSE: Some courses, either by design or in execution, change in such a significant way from offering to offering that repeatable credit is justifiable. Such a course is designated "Repeatable." Departments may request the “Repeatable” designation for a course thru a Course of Instruction (COI) Change Proposal.  The “Repeatable” designation does not apply to those courses which are already repeatable by design, such as 499s (Independent Study courses) or 495s (Special Topics courses).  SPECIAL TOPICS COURSE: Each academic discipline may offer an academic course with the content varying semester to semester, based on cadet or department desires and needs.  Such a course is designated "--------495.  Special Topics."  In the spring, the editor of the Course of Instruction (COI) Supplement publishes a complete listing and description of all special topics courses for the upcoming fall semester.  Spring offerings are published in the fall.  SUMMER ACADEMIC COURSES: Cadets may volunteer or be directed by an Academic Review Committee to take an academic course in lieu of summer break.  Registration for summer academics is in March and April of each year.  TRANSFER CREDIT: Credit given for college-level courses equivalent to Academy courses but taken at another accredited college, university, or secondary school.  A cadet must request this credit and submit a transcript.  Transfer credit standards are the following:  A grade of "B" or higher is generally required for transfer credit for any course in the curriculum. Departments giving mandatory placement examinations to the incoming fourth-class may give transfer credit for core courses when the combination of scores on entrance or placement examination and prior course work is justified even though the course grade is below "B". A department head may ask the Dean of the Faculty to request the Office of Student Academic Affairs withdraw transfer credit.  All transfer/validation credits may be applied toward graduation requirements; however, at least 125 semester hours must be taken at the Academy (or Academy-sponsored exchange programs) to meet minimum residency requirements.  Transfer/validation credit is coordinated with academic departments by DFVRR.  TURNBACK: A cadet who has been transferred from one class to the next succeeding class (e.g., medical, administrative).  If a cadet in deferred turn back status fails to meet graduation requirements by the end of the calendar year in which the cadet's original class graduates, the Academy Board will transfer the cadet to the next succeeding class and the cadet will be designated as a turn back.  UNDERLOAD:  A course load less than minimum requirements reflected in Chapter 2.  VALIDATION CREDIT: Credit given for passing a validation examination or as a result of completing an accelerated or advanced course.  A cadet who has passed college-level courses for which transfer credit is not awarded or who has extensive knowledge of a subject acquired without a formal course may be able to pass a validation examination.  Validation examinations for fourthclass core courses are usually scheduled in the summer.  For other courses, a cadet petitions the appropriate department and may be given an examination if the cadet can furnish evidence to indicate that they have a reasonable chance of passing.  Occasionally, an academic department may invite a cadet to take the examination.  A cadet who passes a validation examination or who makes an acceptable score on a College Board Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) examination may also earn validation credit.  Departments certify this credit to the Office of Student Academic Affairs, Customer Service and Academic Scheduling (DFVRR).  The various academic departments may award validation credit in any academic course (excluding Special Topics and Independent Studies courses).  Except for core courses, validation credit may not be awarded later than a cadet's sixth semester.  No cadet may be given validation credit for a course after attending any class meetings for the same course without expressed approval of the Dean of the Faculty.  All transfer and validation credits may be applied toward graduation requirements; however, at least 125 semester hours must be taken at the Academy (or Academysponsored exchange programs) to meet minimum residency requirements.  The specific residency requirement can be found in Chapter 1.    WACQ: A WACQ (Weekend Academic Call to Quarters) is a 60-minute period of supervised study beyond normal Academic Call to Quarters and required study consultations outlined on the USAFA Form 68. Most often WACQs are accomplished on the weekend and validated weekly by Cadet Academic Officers (CADOs). WACQs are assigned to every cadet on academic probation every grading cycle.  CADOs are responsible for assigning the correct number of WACQs to be accomplished each week based upon the probationary cadet’s performance using the formula provided on Academy Form 68.  For every F grade earned the previous grading cycle, a probationary cadet will be assigned 3 WACQs per week. For every D grade earned, 2 WACQs will be assigned per week.  For every C- grade earned, 1 WACQ will be assigned per week.  For cadets with deficient (below 2.0) core or major’s GPAs but no deficient grades (C-, D, or F), 1 WACQ will be assigned per week.  The cadet can always study more on a given weekend, but that would not relieve the cadet from having supervised study for the minimum WACQs each weekend until the next grading cycle. CADOs are expected to provide guidelines for supervised study that  help the probationary cadets achieve academic excellence.  A probationary cadet may receive credit for 1 WACQ by spending 1 hour in EI with an instructor beyond what is prescribed on the Form 68, at the cadet writing center, at the QRC, or with a squadron assigned tutor during the week. However, all WACQs must be validated as supervised study by the CADO each week. All  WACQs must be accomplished and validated by the CADO before probationary cadets are allowed to utilize passes.   	 INDEX 2025-2026 Course of Instruction Handbook Academic Advising, 40 Academic Course, 476 Academic Day, 476 Academic Div Option, 476 Academic Graduation Requirements, 12 Academic Minors Governance, 115 Minimum Requirements, 111 Academic Requirements.
